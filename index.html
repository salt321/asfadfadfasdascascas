          { speaker: "Librarian", text: "That's why I'm here. What can I do for you?" },
          { speaker: "Student", text: "I'm supposed to do a literature review for my psychology course, but um... having a hard time finding articles. I don't even know where to start looking." },
          { speaker: "Librarian", text: "You said this is for your psychology course, right? So your focus is on ..." },
          { speaker: "Student", text: "Dream Interpretation." },
          { speaker: "Librarian", text: "Well, you have a focus, so that's already a good start. Hmmm... well, there're a few things... oh wait... have you checked to see if your professor put any material for you to look at on reserve?" },
          { speaker: "Student", text: "Aha, that's one thing I did know to do. I just copied an article, but I still need three more on my topic from three different journals." },
          { speaker: "Librarian", text: "Let's get you going on looking for those then. We have printed versions of twenty or so psychology journals in the Reference Section. These are the ones published within the last year. Then I think about it... there's a journal named Sleep and Dream." },
          { speaker: "Student", text: "Oh, yeah, the article I just copied is from that journal, so I've got to look at other sources." },
          { speaker: "Librarian", text: "Ok, actually, most of our materials are available electronically now. You can access psychology databases or electronic journals and articles through the library's computers, and if you want to search by title with the word ‘dream' for example, just type it in and all the articles with ‘dream' in the title will come up on the screen." },
          { speaker: "Student", text: "Cool, that's great! Too bad I cannot do this from home." },
          { speaker: "Librarian", text: "But you can. All of the library's databases and electronic sources can be accessed through any computer connected to the university network." },
          { speaker: "Student", text: "Really?! I can't believe I didn't know that. It still sounds like it's going to take a while though, you know, going through all of that information, all of those sources." },
          { speaker: "Librarian", text: "Maybe, but you already narrow your search down to articles on Dream Interpretation, so it shouldn't be too bad. And you probably notice that there's an abstract or summary at the top of the first page of the article you copied. When you go into the databases and electronic sources, you have the option to display the abstracts on the computer screen, skimming those to decide whether or not you want to read the whole article should cut down some time." },
          { speaker: "Student", text: "Right, abstracts! They'll definitely make the project more doable. I guess I should try out the electronic search while I'm still here then, you know, just in case." },
          { speaker: "Librarian", text: "Sure, er...that computer's free over there, and I'll be here till five this afternoon." },

        "2": [
          { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "Ok, I'm going to begin this lecture by giving you your next assignment. Remember I said that at some point during this semester I wanted you to attend an exhibit at the Fairy Street Gallery and then write about it? Well, the exhibit that I want you to attend is coming up. It's already started in fact, but it'll be at the gallery for the next month, which should give you plenty of time to complete this assignment." },
          { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "The name of the artist exhibiting there is Rose Frantzen. Frantzen's work may be unfamiliar to you since she's a relatively young artist, but she's got a very unusual style, compared to some of the artists we've looked at this term. But anyway, Frantzen's style is what she herself calls Realistic Impressionism. So you've probably studied both of these movements separately, separate movements, Realism and Impressionism, in some of your art history courses. So who can just sum these up?" },
          { "speaker": "Student", "text": "Well, Impressionism started in the late 19th century. Um...the basic impressionist style was very different from earlier styles. It didn't depict scenes or models exactly as they looked. Um... Impressionist painters tended to apply paint really thickly, and in big brushstrokes, so the texture of the canvas was rough." },
          { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "Good. What else? What were the subjects?" },
          { "speaker": "Student", "text": "Well, a lot of impressionist artists painted everyday scenes, like people on the streets and in cafes, lots of nature scenes, especially landscapes." },
          { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "Good. So when you go to the exhibit, I really want you to take a close look at a certain painting. It's a farm scene. And you will see it right as you enter the gallery. The reason I think this painting is so important is that it stresses the impressionist aspect of Frantzen's style. It's an outdoor scene, an everyday scene. It's kind of bleak, which you can really see those broad brushstrokes and the blurry lines." },
          { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "The colors aren't quite realistic. The sky is kind of, well, an unnatural... pinkish yellow. And the fence in the foreground is blue, but somehow the overall scene gives an impression of a cold, bleak, winter day on a farm. So that's the impressionist side of her work. Oh, and speaking about farms, that reminds me one interesting thing I read about Franzten is that when she first moved back to Iowa after living abroad, she often visited this place in her town called the Sales Barn." },
          { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "And the Sales Barn, it was basically this place where the local farmers bought and sold their cattle, their farm animals. And the reason Frantzen went there, and she later on would visit other places like dance halls, was to observe people and the ways that they moved. She really found that this helped her work--that it gave her an understanding of body movements and actions, how humans move, and stand still, what their postures were like, too. So, what about Realism? What are the elements of Realism we should be looking for in Frantzen's work?" },
          { "speaker": "Student", "text": "Um... real honest depictions of subject matter, pretty unidealized stuff, and pretty everyday subject matter, too." },
          { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "Good. One other painting I really want you to look at is of a young woman surrounded by pumpkins. You will notice that the woman's face is so realistic looking that it's almost like a photograph. The woman's nose is a little less than perfect and her hair is kind of messed up. This is realism." },
          { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "But then, the background of the painting, this woman with the pumpkins is wrapped in a blanket of broad thick brushstrokes, and, it's all kinds of zigzagging brushstrokes and lines, kind of chaotic almost when you look at it close. And there are vibrant colors. There's lots of orange, with little hints of an electric blue peeking out." },
          { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "I find Frantzen to be a very accessible artist. I mean, some artists, to appreciate them, you have to know their life story. But here's a little bit about Rose Frantzen's life anyway. She attended art school, but was told by one of her instructors that she was not good at illustration, that she should go into advertising instead." },
          { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "So she took advertising classes and fine arts classes too, until she was convinced by the head of an advertising agency that her work was really good, that she could be an artist." },
          { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "But of course, it's not as easy as that, and so Frantzen had to paint other people's portraits at places like art fairs just to make money to buy paint for her more series of art work. No matter what, she never stopped painting. And now, Frantzen is doing extremely well. And her work is being shown all over the country." },
          { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "So I think most of us would be discouraged if we had to face challenges and difficulties like that. But what's important is that you keep at it that you don't give up. That's what is really important to remember." }

          { "speaker": "Narrator", "text": "Listen to part of a lecture in a geology class." },
          { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "Ok, let’s get started. Great. Today I want to talk about a way in which we are able to determine how old a piece of land, or some other geologic feature is - dating techniques. I’m going to talk about a particular dating technique. Why? Good dating is a key to good analysis. In other words, if you want to know how a land formation was formed, the first thing you probably want to know is how old it is. It’s fundamental." },
          { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "Um… Take the Grand Canyon for instance. Now, we geologists thought we had a pretty good idea of how the Grand Canyon in the southwestern United States was formed. We knew that it was formed from sandstone that solidified somewhere between 150 and 300 million years ago. Before it solidified, it was just regular sand. Essentially, it was part of a vast desert." },
          { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "And until just recently, most of us thought the sand had come from an ancient mountain range fairly close by that flattened out over time. That’s been the conventional wisdom among geologists for quite some time. But now we’ve learned something different, and quite surprising, using a technique called Uranium-Lead Dating." },
          { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "I should say that Uranium-Lead Dating has been around for quite a while. But there have been some recent refinements. I will get into this in a minute. Anyway, Uranium-Lead Dating has produced some surprises. Two geologists discovered that about half of the sand from the Grand Canyon was actually once part of the Appalachian Mountains. That’s really eye-opening news, since the Appalachian Mountain Range is, of course, thousands of kilometers to the east of the Grand Canyon. Sounds pretty unbelievable, right?" },
          { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "Of course, the obvious question is how did that sand end up so far west? The theory is that huge rivers and wind carried the sand west where it mixed in with the sand that was already there. Well, this was a pretty revolutionary finding. Um… and it was basically because of Uranium-Lead Dating. Why?" },
          { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "Well, as everyone in this class should know, we usually look at the grain type within sandstone, meaning the actual particles in the sandstone, to determine where it came from. You can do other things too, like look at the wind or water that brought the grains to their location and figure out which way it was flowing. But that’s only useful up to a point, and that’s not what these two geologists did." },
          { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "Uranium-Lead Dating allowed them to go about it in an entirely different way. What they did was: they looked at the grains of Zircon in the sandstone. Zircon is a material that contains radioactive Uranium, which makes it very useful for dating purposes." },
          { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "Zircon starts off as molten magma, the hot lava from volcanoes. This magma then crystallizes. And when Zircon crystallizes, the Uranium inside it begins to change into Lead. So if you measure the amount of Lead in the Zircon grain, you can figure out when the grain was formed. After that, you can determine the age of Zircon from different mountain ranges." },
          { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "Once you do that, you can compare the age of the Zircon in the sandstone in your sample to the age of the Zircon in the mountains. If the age of the Zircon matches the age of one of your mountain ranges, then it means the sandstone actually used to be part of that particular mountain range. Is everybody with me on that? Good. So, in this case, Uranium-Lead Dating was used to establish that half of the sandstone in the samples was formed at the same time the granite in the Appalachian Mountains was formed." },
          { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "So because of this, this new way of doing Uranium-Lead Dating, we’ve been able to determine that one of our major assumptions about the Grand Canyon was wrong. Like I said before, Uranium-Lead Dating has been with us for a while. But, um… until recently, in order to do it, you really had to study many individual grains. And it took a long time before you got results. It just wasn’t very efficient. And it wasn’t very accurate." },
          { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "But technical advances have cut down on the number of grains you have to study, so you get your results faster. So I’ll predict that Uranium-Lead Dating is going to become an increasingly popular dating method. There are a few pretty exciting possibilities for Uranium-Lead Dating." },
          { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "Here is one that comes to mind. You know the theory that earth’s continents were once joined together and only split apart relatively recently? Well, with Uranium-Lead Dating, we could prove that more conclusively. If they show evidence of once having been joined, that could really tell us a lot about the early history of the planet’s geology." }

          { "speaker": "Narrator", "text": "Listen to part of a conversation between a student and his professor." },
          { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "Hi Mathew, I'm glad you can come in today. You've been observing Mr. Grable's third-grade class for your approaches to education paper, right?" },
          { "speaker": "Student", "text": "Hmmm, yes. I go over the Johnson Elementary School, you know, to watch Mr. Grable teach the children in class. It's been amazing, I mean, I'm just learning so much from just watching him. I'm so glad the classroom observations are a requirement for the education program. I mean it's like the best thing ever to prepare you to be a good teacher." },
          { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "Well, I'm glad to see you feel that way, Mathew. You know, that's the goal. So, I've been reading over your observation notes and I'm quite interested in what's going on, in particular what's the astronomy unit he's been teaching." },
          { "speaker": "Student", "text": "The astronomy unit?" },
          { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "It seems that Mr. Grable has mastered the interdisciplinary approach to teaching — the way we've been talking about in class." },
          { "speaker": "Student", "text": "Oh! OK, yeah, so like when he was teaching them astronomy, he didn't just teach them the names of the planets, he used it as a way to teach mythology." },
          { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "Really! So, how did he do that?" },
          { "speaker": "Student", "text": "Well, some of the students could already name the planets, but they didn't know that the names had any meaning — the stories behind them." },
          { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "So, he..." },
          { "speaker": "Student", "text": "He introduced Greek and Roman mythology as a way of explaining. Like, you know, how like Jupiter's the biggest planet, right, and how Jupiter was the name of the king of the gods in Roman mythology, right? So since Jupiter, the planet, is the largest planet in our solar system, it's like the king of the planets, like Jupiter was the king of all the gods." },
          { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "Oh, Mathew, that's a great example." },
          { "speaker": "Student", "text": "Yeah! And each student chose a planet and then did research on it to write a report and make a presentation. They went to the library to do the research, then they made presentations about the planet they chose." },
          { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "So, in one science unit, in which the focus was astronomy, the students also learned about the literature of Greek and Roman mythology, used research skills in the library, wrote a report and practiced their oral presentation skills." },
          { "speaker": "Student", "text": "Exactly! He used this one topic to teach third-graders all that stuff — how to use the books in the library, to write reports, and even how to speak in public. Plus they had a great time doing it." },
          { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "You know, Mathew, this is just what we've been talking about in our class. I'm sure everyone can learn something from your experience. You know, Mathew, I'd love for you to talk about this astronomy unit in class on Wednesday." },
          { "speaker": "Student", "text": "Really?! Hmmm... ‘cause I don't really think I'll have any time to write my paper by then." },
          { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "Oh, you won't need to write anything new just yet. For Wednesday, use your class observation notes and explain the things we've discussed today." },
          { "speaker": "Student", "text": "Ok, that sounds all right." }

        "5": [
        { "speaker": "Narrator", "text": "Listen to part of a lecture in an archeology class." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "OK, we’ve been talking about early agriculture in the near east. So let’s concentrate on one site and see what we can learn from it. Let’s look at Catalhoyuk. Ah… I’d better write that down. Catalhoyuk, that’s about as close as we get in English. It’s Turkish, really. The sites in modern day Turkey, and who knows what the original inhabitants called it." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "Anyway, uh…Catalhoyuk wasn’t the first agricultural settlement in the near east, but it was pretty early, settled about 9000 years ago in the Neolithic period. And ... umm... the settlement...ah...town really, lasted about a thousand years and grew to a size of about eight or ten thousand people. That certainly makes it one of the largest towns in the world at that time." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "One of the things that make the settlement of this size impressive is the time period. It’s the Neolithic, remember, the late Stone Age. So the people that lived there had only stone tools, no metals. So everything they accomplished, like building this town, they did with just stone, plus wood, bricks, that sort of thing." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "But you got to remember that it wasn’t just any stone they had, they had obsidian. And umm... obsidian is a black, volcanic, well, almost like glass. It flakes very nicely into really sharp points. The sharpest tools of the entire Stone Age were made of obsidian. And urrr... the people of Catalhoyuk got theirs from further inland, from central Turkey, traded for it, probably." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "Anyway, what I wanna focus on is the way the town was built. The houses are all rectangular, one storey made of sun dried bricks. But what’s really interesting is that there are no spaces between them, no streets in other words, and so generally no doors on the houses either. People walked around on the roofs and entered the house through a hatchway on the roof, down a wooden ladder. You can still see the diagonal marks of the ladders in the plaster on the inside walls." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "Once you were in the house, there would be one main room and a couple of small rooms for storage. The main room had the hearths, for cooking and for heat. It would’ve been pretty cold during the winters. And it also looks like they made their tools near the fire. There tends to be a lot of obsidian flakes and chips in the hearth ashes, but no chimney." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "The smoke just went out the same hatchway that people used for going in and out themselves. So there would have been an open fire inside the house with only one hole in the roof to let the smoke out. You and I would have found it a bit too smoky in there. You can see on the walls, which they plastered and decorated with paintings. They ended up with a layer of black soot on them, and so did people’s lungs. The bones found in the graves show a layer of soot on the inside of the ribs. And that’s another unusual feature of Catalhoyuk, the burial sites." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "The graves have all been found under the houses, right under the floors. And it maybe this burial custom that explains why the houses were packed in so tightly without streets. I mean, you might think it was for protection or something, but there has been no evidence found yet of any violent attack that would indicate that kind of danger. It maybe they wanted to live as near as possible to their ancestors’ graves and be buried near them themselves. But it makes a good point." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "Based on excavations, we can know the layout of the houses and the location of the graves, but we’re only guessing when we tried to say why they did it that way. That’s the way it is with archeology. You are dealing with the physical remains that people left behind. We have no sure access to what they thought and how they felt about things. I mean it’s interesting to speculate. And the physical artifacts can give us clues, but there is a lot we can’t really know." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "So, for instance, their art. They painted on the plastered walls and usually they painted hunting scenes with wild animals in them. Now they did hunt and they also raised cereal crops and kept sheep, but we don’t know why so many of the paintings are of hunting scenes. Was it supposed to have religious or magical significance? That’s the kind of thing we can only guess at based on clues. And hopefully, further excavation of Catalhoyuk will yield more clues. But we’ll probably never know for sure." }

        { "speaker": "Narrator", "text": "Listen to part of a lecture in a biology class." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "For today's discussion, we'll review the case study on how some animals have behaviorally adapted to their environments. Now you had to read about two animal species, the Eastern marmot and the Olympic marmot." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "Marmots are rodents. They are large ground squirrels, about the size of an average house cat. And they live in a variety of habitats. And even though they spend the significant portion of the year hibernating, according to this case study, marmots are still considered excellent subjects for animal behavioral studies. Why is that?" },
        { "speaker": "Student", "text": "Well, when they are not hibernating, you can find them in open areas. And they are pretty active during the day, which makes them easy to observe, right?" },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "Uh-ha, so first let's discuss the Eastern marmots. They reside throughout the eastern region of North America where there is a temperate climate, where the growing season lasts for at least five months of the year, which is when they do all their mating, playing and eating." },
        { "speaker": "Student", "text": "Oh, I see. At first I wasn't sure what growing season meant, just from the reading, but now I get it. It's the amount of time it takes for them to grow, right? So it would be five months?" },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "Umm? Oh, uh... I'm sorry but no. It has nothing to do with that. It's not about the time it takes for Eastern marmots to grow. It's when the food is available. That is when it's not covered in snow and there is no frost covering the grass and, umm, vegetative parts of a plant's herbs and the flowers the marmots like to eat. So growing season refers to the availability of the food they eat, OK? So now how would you describe the Eastern marmots' social habits?" },
        { "speaker": "Student", "text": "Well, they are really territorial, and loners, and just so aggressive even with other Eastern marmots. And their mating ritual is just so impersonal." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "Uh-ha? Now when they emerge in the spring from hibernation, the mating process begins. For them, well, they come together to mate and then they go their separate ways. Then about six to eight weeks after birth, the offspring leave their mothers." },
        { "speaker": "Student", "text": "Really? Just six weeks? Is that possible for the offspring to make it on their own so young?" },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "Well, it's not as if they aren't ready for the real world because they are. Remember, they mature quickly and the weather's nice. Also they live in open fields where there is lots of edible vegetation. So roughly six weeks after birth, Eastern marmots are just old enough to take their chances of surviving in the temperate environment. So how does this relate to their behavior?" },
        { "speaker": "Student", "text": "Oh, I get it. Since the climate's not too bad, the Eastern marmots don't have to rely on each other too much and they really don't need to stay together as a family to survive either." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "Uh-ha. Any contrast, the Olympic marmots? What about them?" },
        { "speaker": "Student", "text": "Well, they live together as a family and take care of their young until they are at least two years old. They're really friendly with each other. And what I really like is that they even have greeting ceremonies. And they are not at all aggressive and territorial like the Eastern marmots. So their social behavior is so different from Eastern marmots because of the climate where they live? That seems so bizarre." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "Well, the Olympic marmots inhabit meadows high in the Olympic Mountains where the weather conditions are much harsher. So there is a lot more wind and snow. The growing season only lasts about two to three months. So in that much shorter period of time, all the Olympic marmots, male and female, eat, play, work and nurture the young together." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "Because the climate is so harsh, cooperation increases the survival rate of the Olympic marmots. They keep their young at home until they are physically able to survive on their own. This could explain why the social behavior of the Olympic marmots is so unlike that of the Eastern marmots." }

        { "speaker": "Student", "text": "OK. So, for example, I studied meteorological records. I looked at climate charts. I used different methods for analyzing the data, like certain statistical tests, and then I discuss the results. Is that what you mean?" },

        { "speaker": "Narrator", "text": "Listen to part of a psychology lecture. The professor is discussing behaviorism." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "Now, many people consider John Watson to be the founder of behaviorism. And like other behaviorists, he believed that psychologists should study only the behaviors they can observe and measure. They’re not interested in mental processes. While a person could describe his thoughts, no one else can see or hear them to verify the accuracy of his report." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "But one thing you can observe is muscular habits. What Watson did was to observe muscular habits because he viewed them as a manifestation of thinking. One kind of habit that he studied are laryngeal habits. Watson thought laryngeal habits . . . you know, from larynx, in other words, related to the voice box . . ." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "He thought those habits were an expression of thinking. He argued that for very young children, thinking is really talking out loud to oneself because they talk out loud even if they’re not trying to communicate with someone in particular. As the individual matures, that overt talking to oneself becomes covert talking to oneself, but thinking still shows up as a laryngeal habit." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "One of the bits of evidence that supports this is that when people are trying to solve a problem, they, um, typically have increased muscular activity in the throat region. That is, if you put electrodes on the throat and measure muscle potential—muscle activity—you discover that when people are thinking, like if they’re diligently trying to solve a problem, that there is muscular activity in the throat region." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "So, Watson made the argument that problem solving, or thinking, can be defined as a set of behaviors—a set of responses—and in this case the response he observed was the throat activity. That’s what he means when he calls it a laryngeal habit. Now, as I am thinking about what I am going to be saying, my muscles in my throat are responding. So, thinking can be measured as muscle activity. Now, the motor theory . . . yes?" },
        { "speaker": "Student", "text": "Professor Blake, um, did he happen to look at people who sign? I mean deaf people?" },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "Uh, he did indeed, um, and to jump ahead, what one finds in deaf individuals who use sign language when they’re given problems of various kinds, they have muscular changes in their hands when they are trying to solve a problem . . .muscle changes in the hand, just like the muscular changes going on in the throat region for speaking individuals. So, for Watson, thinking is identical with the activity of muscles." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "A related concept of thinking was developed by William James. It’s called ideomotor action. Ideomotor action is an activity that occurs without our noticing it, without our being aware of it. I’ll give you one simple example. If you think of locations, there tends to be eye movement that occurs with your thinking about that location. In particular, from where we’re sitting, imagine that you’re asked to think of our university library." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "Well, if you close your eyes and think of the library, and if you’re sitting directly facing me, then according to this notion, your eyeballs will move slightly to the left, to your left, ‘cause the library’s in that general direction. James and others said that this is an idea leading to a motor action, and that’s why it’s called “ideomotor action”—an idea leads to motor activity." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "If you wish to impress your friends and relatives, you can change this simple process into a magic trick. Ask people to do something such as I’ve just described: think of something on their left; think of something on their right. You get them to think about two things on either side with their eyes closed, and you watch their eyes very carefully. And if you do that, you’ll discover that you can see rather clearly the eye movement—that is, you can see the movement of the eyeballs." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "Now, then you say, think of either one and I’ll tell which you’re thinking of. OK. Well, Watson makes the assumption that muscular activity is equivalent to thinking. But given everything we’ve been talking about here, one has to ask: are there alternatives to this motor theory—this claim that muscular activities are equivalent to thinking? Is there anything else that might account for this change in muscular activity, other than saying that it is thinking? And the answer is clearly yes. Is there any way to answer the question definitively? I think the answer is no." }

It typically runs between 50 and 60 percent on the day the research paper is due. Um, I was hoping to have your exams back today, but, uh, the situation was that I went away for the weekend, and I was supposed to get in yesterday at five, and I expected to fully complete all the exams by midnight or so, which is the time that I usually go to bed, but my flight was delayed, and I ended up not getting in until one o'clock in the morning. Anyway, I'll do my best to have them finished by the next time we meet." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "OK. In the last class, we started talking about useful plant fibers. In particular, we talked about cotton fibers, which we said were very useful, not only in the textile industry, but also in the chemical industry, and in the production of many products, such as plastics, paper, explosives, and so on. Today we'll continue talking about useful fibers, and we'll begin with a fiber that's commonly known as 'Manila hemp.'" },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "Now, for some strange reason, many people believe that Manila hemp is a hemp plant. But Manila hemp is not really hemp. It's actually a member of the banana family—it even bears little banana-shaped fruits. The 'Manila' part of the name makes sense, because Manila hemp is produced chiefly in the Philippine Islands and, of course, the capital city of the Philippines is Manila." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "Now, as fibers go, Manila hemp fibers are very long. They can easily be several feet in length and they're also very strong, very flexible. They have one more characteristic that's very important, and that is that they are exceptionally resistant to salt water. And this combination of characteristics—long, strong, flexible, resistant to salt water—makes Manila hemp a great material for ropes, especially for ropes that are gonna be used on ocean-going ships." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "In fact, by the early 1940's, even though steel cables were available, most ships in the United States Navy were not moored with steel cables; they were moored with Manila hemp ropes. Now, why was that? Well, the main reason was that steel cables degrade very, very quickly in contact with salt water. If you've ever been to San Francisco, you know that the Golden Gate Bridge is red. And it's red because of the zinc paint that goes on those stainless steel cables." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "That, if they start at one end of the bridge and they work to the other end, by the time they finish, it's already time to go back and start painting the beginning of the bridge again, because the bridge was built with steel cables, and steel cables can't take the salt air unless they're treated repeatedly with a zinc-based paint." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "On the other hand, plant products like Manila hemp, you can drag through the ocean for weeks on end. If you wanna tie your anchor to it and drop it right into the ocean, that's no problem, because plant fibers can stand up for months, even years, in direct contact with salt water." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "OK. So how do you take plant fibers that individually you could break with your hands and turn them into a rope that's strong enough to moor a ship that weighs thousands of tons? Well, what you do is you extract these long fibers from the Manila hemp plant, and then you take several of these fibers, and you group them into a bundle, because by grouping the fibers you greatly increase their breaking strength—that bundle of fibers is much stronger than any of the individual fibers that compose it." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "And then you take that bundle of fibers and you twist it a little bit, because by twisting it, you increase its breaking strength even more. And then you take several of these little bundles, and you group and twist them into bigger bundles, which you then group and twist into even bigger bundles, and so on, until eventually, you end up with a very, very strong rope." }

        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "OK. Another ancient Greek philosopher we need to discuss is Aristotle—Aristotle’s ethical theory. What Aristotle’s ethical theory is all about is this: he’s trying to show you how to be happy—what true happiness is." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "Now, why is he interested in human happiness? It’s not just because it’s something that all people want or aim for. It’s more than that. But to get there we need to first make a very important distinction." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "Let me introduce a couple of technical terms: extrinsic value and intrinsic value. To understand Aristotle’s interest in happiness, you need to understand this distinction." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "Some things we aim for and value, not for themselves but for what they bring about in addition to themselves. If I value something as a means to something else, then it has what we will call 'extrinsic value.' Other things we desire and hold to be valuable for themselves alone. If we value something not as a means to something else, but for its own sake, let us say that it has 'intrinsic value.'" },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "Exercise. There may be some people who value exercise for itself, but I don’t. I value exercise because if I exercise, I tend to stay healthier than I would if I didn’t. So I desire to engage in exercise and I value exercise extrinsically, not for its own sake, but as a means to something beyond it. It brings me good health." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "Health. Why do I value good health? Well, here it gets a little more complicated for me. Um, health is important for me because I can’t…do other things I want to do—play music, teach philosophy—if I’m ill. So health is important to me—has value to me—as a means to a productive life. But health is also important to me because I just kind of like to be healthy—it feels good. It’s pleasant to be healthy, unpleasant not to be. So to some degree, I value health both for itself and as a means to something else: productivity. It’s got extrinsic and intrinsic value for me." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "Then there’s some things that are just valued for themselves. I’m a musician, not a professional musician; I just play a musical instrument for fun. Why do I value playing music? Well, like most amateur musicians, I only play because, well, I just enjoy it. It’s something that’s an end in itself." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "Now, something else I value is teaching. Why? Well, it brings in a modest income, but I could make more money doing other things. I’d do it even if they didn’t pay me. I just enjoy teaching. In that sense it’s an end to itself. But teaching’s not something that has intrinsic value for all people—and that’s true generally." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "Most things that are enjoyed in and of themselves vary from person to person. Some people value teaching intrinsically, but others don’t. So how does all this relate to human happiness?" },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "Well, Aristotle asks: is there something that all human beings value . . . and value only intrinsically, for its own sake and only for its own sake? If you could find such a thing, that would be the universal final good, or truly the ultimate purpose or goal for all human beings." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "Aristotle thought the answer was yes. What is it? Happiness. Everyone will agree, he argues, that happiness is the ultimate end to be valued for itself and really only for itself. For what other purpose is there in being happy? What does it yield? The attainment of happiness becomes the ultimate or highest good for Aristotle." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "The next question that Aristotle raises is: what is happiness? We all want it; we all desire it; we all seek it. It’s the goal we have in life. But what is it? How do we find it? Here he notes, with some frustration, people disagree. But he does give us a couple of criteria, or features, to keep in mind as we look for what true human happiness is." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "True human happiness should be, as he puts it, complete. Complete in that it’s all we require. Well, true human happiness…if you had that, what else do you need? Nothing." },

        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "Many people value fame and seek fame. Fame for them becomes the goal. But, according to Aristotle, this won’t work either, because fame depends altogether too much on other people. I can’t get it on my own, without help from other people." },

So people went to work on finding objects that would be at that missing distance from the Sun, and then in 1801, the object Ceres was discovered." },

Um, and so, Ceres was the first and is the largest of what became many objects discovered at that same distance. Not just one thing, but all the objects found at that distance from the asteroid belt.

        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "Now, we've been talking about the loss of animal habitat from housing developments, uh ..., growing cities – small habitat losses. But today I wanna begin talking about what happens when habitat is reduced across a large area. There are, of course, animal species that require large areas of habitat, and some migrate over very long distances. So what's the impact of habitat loss on those animals – animals that need large areas of habitat?" },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "Well, I'll use the humming birds as an example. Now you know a humming bird is amazingly small, but even though it's really tiny, it migrates over very long distances, travels up and down the western hemisphere – the Americas, back and forth between where it breeds in the summer and the warmer climates where it spends the winter. So you would say that this whole area over which it migrates is its habitat because on this long distance journey, it needs to come down to feed and sleep every so often, right?" },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "Well, the humming bird beats its wings – get this – about 3 thousand times per minute. So you think, wow, it must need a lot of energy, a lot of food, right? Well, it does. It drinks a lot of nectar from flowers and feeds on some insects, but it's energy efficient too. You can't say it isn't. I mean, as it flies all the way across the Gulf of Mexico, it uses up none of its body fat." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "But that doesn't mean it doesn't need to eat. So humming birds have to rely on plants in their natural habitat. And it goes without saying, but the opposite is true as well, plants depend on humming birds too. There are some flowers that can only be pollinated by the humming birds. Without it stopping to feed and spread pollen from flower to flower, these plants would cease to exist." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "But the problem, well, as natural habitat along these migration routes is developed by humans for housing or agriculture or cleared for raising cattle, for instance, there is less food available for migrating humming birds. Their nesting sites are affected too, the same by the same sorts of human activities. And all of these activities pose a real threat to the humming bird population. So to help them survive, we need to preserve their habitats." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "And one of the concrete ways people have been doing this is by cleaning up polluted habitat areas and then replanting flowers, um, replanting native flowers that humming birds feed on. Promoting ecological tourism is another way to help save their habitat. As the number of visitors, eco-tourists who come to humming bird habitats to watch the birds, the more the number of visitors grows, the more local businesses' profit, so ecological tourism can bring financial rewards, all the more reason to value these beautiful little creatures in their habitat, right?" },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "But to understand more about how to protect and support the humming birds the best we can, we've got to learn more about their breeding, nesting sites and migration routes, and also about the natural habitats we find there. That should help us determine how to prevent further decline in the population. A good research method, a good way to learn more, is by running a banding study." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "Banding the birds allows us to track them over their lifetime. It's been a practice that's been used by researchers for years. In fact, most of what we known about humming birds comes from banding studies, where we capture a humming bird and make sure all the information about it, like its weight and age and length, are all recorded and put into an international information database." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "And then we place an extremely lightweight band on one of its legs, well, what looks like a leg, although technically it's considered part of the bird's foot. Anyway, these bands are perfectly safe, and some humming birds have worn them for years with no evidence of any problems. The band is labeled with a tracking number, oh, and there is a phone number on the band for people to call for free, to report a banded bird they've found or recaptured." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "So when a banded bird is recaptured and reported, we learn about its migration route, its growth, and how long it has been alive, its lifespan. One recaptured bird had been almost 12 years earlier – she was one of the oldest humming birds on record. Another interesting thing we've learned is that some humming birds, um, they no longer use a certain route. They travel by a different route to reach their destination. And findings like these have been of interest to biologists and environmental scientists in a number of countries who are trying to understand the complexities of how changes in a habitat affect the species in it." }

        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "Okay, we’ve been discussing films in the 1920s and 30s, and how back then film categories, as we know them today, had not yet been established. We said that by today’s standards, many of the films of the 20s and 30s would be considered hybrids, that is, a mixture of styles that wouldn’t exactly fit into any of today’s categories, and in that context." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "Today we are going to talk about a film-maker who began making very unique films in the late 1920s. He was French, and his name was Jean Painlevé. Jean Painlevé was born in 1902. He made his first film in 1928. Now in a way, Painlevé’s films conform to norms of the 20s and 30s, that is, they don’t fit very neatly into the categories we use to classify films today. That said, even by the standards of the 20s and 30s, Painlevé’s films were unique, a hybrid of styles." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "He had a special way of fusing, or some people might say confusing, science and fiction. His films begin with facts, but then they become more and more fictional. They gradually add more and more fictional elements. In fact, Painlevé was known for saying that science is fiction." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "Painlevé was a pioneer in underwater film-making, and a lot of his short films focused on the aquatic animal world. He liked to show small underwater creatures, displaying what seemed like familiar human characteristics – what we think of as unique to humans. He might take a clip of a mollusk going up and down in the water and set it to music." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "You know, to make it look like the mollusk were dancing to the music like a human being – that sort of thing. But then he suddenly changed the image or narration to remind us how different the animals are, how unlike humans. He confused his audience in the way he portrayed the animals he filmed, mixing up on notions of the categories of humans and animals." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "The films make us a little uncomfortable at times because we are uncertain about what we are seeing. It gives him films an uncanny feature: the familiar made unfamiliar, the normal made suspicious. He liked twists, he liked the unusual. In fact, one of his favorite sea animals was the seahorse because with seahorses, it’s the male that carries the eggs, and he thought that was great. His first and most celebrated underwater film is about the seahorse." },

        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "Well, actually, it was pretty rare at that time. I mean, we are talking about the early 1930s." },
        { "speaker": "Student 1", "text": "But what about Jacques Cousteau? Was he like an innovator, you know, with underwater photography too?" },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "Ah, Jacques Cousteau. Well, Painlevé and Cousteau did both film underwater, and they were both innovators, so you are right in that sense. But that’s pretty much where the similarities end. First of all, Painlevé was about 20 years ahead of Cousteau." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "And Cousteau’s adventures were high-tech, with lots of fancy equipment, whereas Painlevé kind of patched the equipment together as he needed it. Cousteau usually filmed large animals, usually in the open sea, whereas Painlevé generally filmed smaller animals, and he liked to film in shallow water." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "Uh, what else, oh well, the main difference was that Cousteau simply investigated and presented the facts – he didn’t mix in fiction. He was a strict documentarist. He set the standard really for the nature documentary. Painlevé, on the other hand, as we said before, mixed in elements of fiction. And his films are much more artistic, incorporating music as an important element." },
        { "speaker": "Student 2", "text": "Well, maybe I shouldn’t be asking this, but if Painlevé’s films are so special, so good, why haven’t we ever heard of them? I mean, everyone’s heard of Jacques Cousteau." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "Well, that’s a fair question. Uh, the short answer is that Painlevé’s style just never caught on with the general public. I mean, it probably goes back at least in part to where we mentioned earlier, that people didn’t know what to make of his films – they were confused by them, whereas Cousteau’s documentaries were very straightforward, met people’s expectations more than Painlevé’s films did. But you are true: film history buffs know about them. And Painlevé is still highly respected in many circles." }

        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "Some of the world’s oldest preserved art is the cave art of Europe, most of it in Spain and France. And the earliest cave paintings found to date are those of the Chauvet Cave in France discovered in 1994. And you know, I remember when I heard about the results of the dating of the Chauvet paintings, I said to my wife, “Can you believe these paintings are over 30,000 years old?” And my 3-yearold daughter piped up and said, “Is that older than my great-grandmother?” That was the oldest age she knew." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "And you know, come to think of it. It’s pretty hard for me to really understand how long 30,000 years is too. I mean, we tend to think that people who lived at that time must have been pretty primitive. But I’m gonna show you some slides in a few minutes and I think you will agree with me that this art is anything but primitive. They are masterpieces. And they look so real, so alive that it’s very hard to imagine that they are so very old." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "Now, not everyone agrees on exactly how old. A number of the Chauvet paintings have been dated by a lab to 30,000 or more years ago. That would make them not just older than any other cave art, but about twice as old as the art in the caves at Altamira or Lascaux, which you may have heard of." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "Some people find it hard to believe Chauvet is so much older than Altamira and Lascaux, and they noted that only one lab did the dating for Chauvet, without independent confirmation from any other lab. But be that as it may, whatever the exact date, whether it’s 15,000, 20,000 or 30,000 years ago, the Chauvet paintings are from the dawn of art. So they are a good place to start our discussion of cave painting." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "Now, one thing you’ve got to remember is the context of these paintings. Paleolithic humans - that’s the period we are talking about here, the Paleolithic, the early Stone Age, not too long after humans first arrived in Europe——the climate was significantly colder then and so rock shelters, shallow caves were valued as homes protected from the wind and rain." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "And in some cases at least, artists drew on the walls of their homes. But many of the truly great cave art sites like Chauvet were never inhabited. These paintings were made deep inside a dark cave, where no natural light can penetrate. There’s no evidence of people ever living here. Cave bears, yes, but not humans. You would have had to make a special trip into the cave to make the paintings, and a special trip to go see it. And each time you’d have to bring along torches to light your way. And people did go see the art." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "There are charcoal marks from their torches on the cave walls clearly dating from thousands of years after the paintings were made. So we can tell people went there. They came but they didn’t stay. Deep inside a cave like that is not really a place you’d want to stay, so, why? What inspired the Paleolithic artists to make such beautiful art in such inaccessible places? We’ll never really know of course, though it’s interesting to speculate." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "But, um, getting to the paintings themselves, virtually all Paleolithic cave art represents animals, and Chauvet is no exception. The artists were highly skilled at using, or even enhancing, the natural shape of the cave walls to give depth and perspectives to their drawings, the sense of motion and vitality in these animals. Well, wait till I show you the slides." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "Anyway, most Paleolithic cave art depicts large herbivores. Horses are most common overall with deer and bison pretty common too, probably animals they hunted. But earlier at Chauvet, there is a significant interest in large dangerous animals, lots of rhinoceros, lions, mammoth, bears. Remember that the ranges of many animal species were different back then so all these animals actually lived in the region at that time." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "But the Chauvet artists didn’t paint people. There is a half-man-half-bison creature and there is outline of human hands but no depiction of a full human. So, why these precise animals? Why not birds, fish, snakes? Was it for their religion, magic or sheer beauty? We don’t know. But whatever it was, it was worth it to them to spend hours deep inside a cave with just a torch between them and utter darkness. So, on that note, let’s dim the lights, so we can see these slides and actually look at the techniques they used." }

Spectroscopy is basically the study of spectra and spectral lines of light, and specifically for us, the light from stars. It makes it possible to analyze the light emitted from stars. When you analyze this light, you can figure out their distance from the earth, and identify what they are made of, determine their chemical composition." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "Before we get into that though, it's probably a good thing to back up a bit. You all know how when you take a crystal prism and pass a beam of sunlight through it, you get a spectrum, which looks like a continuous band of rainbow colors. The light that we see with our human eyes as a band of rainbow color falls in a range of what's called visible light. And visible light spectroscopy is probably the most important kind of spectroscopy. Anyone want to take a stab at the scientific term for visible light? And I'm sure all of you know this because you all did the reading for today." },

        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "Yes, and no. If you are talking about radiation, like in the element Uranium, yeah, that's dangerous. But radiation as a general term actually refers to anything that spreads away from its source. So optical radiation is just visible light energy spreading out." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "OK, so we've got a spectrum of a beam of sunlight and it looks like the colors bleed into each other. There are no interruptions, just a band flowing from violet to green, to yellow, to... you get the idea. Well, what happens if the sunlight's spectrum is magnified? Maybe you all didn't do the reading. Well, here's what you'd see. I want you to know this that this spectrum is interrupted by dark lines called spectral lines." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "If you really magnify the spectrum of the sunlight, you could identify more than 100,000 of them. They may look like kind of randomly placed, but they actually form many distinct patterns. And if you were looking at the spectrum of some other star, the colors would be the same. But the spectral lines would break it up at different places, making different patterns. Each pattern stands for a distinct chemical element, and so different sets or patterns of spectral lines mean that the star has a different chemical composition." },
        { "speaker": "Student", "text": "So how do we know which spectral patterns match up with which elements?" },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "Well, a kind of spectroscopic library of elements was compiled using flame tests. A known element, say a piece of iron for example, is heated in a pure gas flame. The iron eventually heats to the point that it radiates light. This light is passed through a prism, which breaks it up into a spectrum. And a unique pattern, kind of like a chemical fingerprint of spectral lines for that element appears." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "This process was repeated over and over again for many different elements, so we can figure out the chemical makeup of another star by comparing the spectral pattern it has to the pattern of the elements in the library. Oh, an interesting story about how one of the elements was discovered through spectroscopy. There was a pretty extensive library of spectral line patterns of elements even by the 1860s." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "A British astronomer was analyzing a spectrograph of sunlight, and he noticed a particular pattern of spectral lines that didn't match anything in the library. So he put two and two together, and decided there was an element in the sun that hadn't been discovered here on the earth yet. Any guesses about what that element is? It actually turned out to be pretty common and I'm sure all of you know it. OK. Let's try something else. Any of you happened to be familiar with the Greek word for “sun” by chance?" },

It’s appropriate under the circumstances. But what doesn’t make sense is the object the behavior’s directed towards. Ok, who else? Carol?" },
        { "speaker": "Carol", "text": "I think I read in another class about an experiment where an object that the animal was afraid of was put next to its food – next to the animal’s food. And the animal, it was conflicted between confronting the object and eating the food, so instead, it just fell asleep. Like that?" },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "That’s exactly what I mean. Displacement occurs because the animal’s got two conflicting drives – two competing urges, in this case, fear and hunger. And what happens is, they inhibit each other, they cancel each other out in a way, and a third seemingly irrelevant behavior surfaces through a process that we call ‘Disinhibition’. Now in disinhibition, the basic idea is that two drives that seem to inhibit, to hold back, a third drive." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "Or, well, they’re getting in a way of each other in a… in a conflict situation and somehow lose control, lose their inhibiting effect on that third behavior, which means that the third drive surfaces, it’s expressed in the animal’s behavior." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "Now, these displacement activities can include feeding, drinking, grooming, even sleeping. These are what we call ‘Comfort Behavior’. So why do you think displacement activities are so often comfort behaviors, such as grooming?" },
        { "speaker": "Karl", "text": "Maybe because it’s easy for them to do? I mean, grooming is like one of the most accessible things an animal can do. It’s something they do all the time, and they have the stimulus right there on the outside of their bodies in order to do the grooming, or if food is right in front of them. Basically, they don’t have to think very much about those behaviors." },
        { "speaker": "Carol", "text": "Professor, isn’t it possible that animals groom because they’ve got messed up a little from fighting or mating? I mean if a bird’s feathers get ruffled or an animal’s fur, maybe it’s not so strange for them to stop and tidy themselves up at that point." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "That’s another possible reason although it doesn’t necessarily explain other behaviors such as eating, drinking or sleeping. What’s interesting is that studies have been done that suggest that the animal’s environment may play a part in determining what kind of behavior it displays." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "For example, there’s a bird, the ‘wood thrush’, anyway, when the ‘wood thrush’ is in an attack-escape conflict, that is, it’s caught between the two urges to escape from or to attack an enemy, if it’s sitting on a horizontal branch, it’ll wipe its beak on its perch. If it’s sitting on a vertical branch, it’ll groom its breast feathers. The immediate environment of the bird, its immediate, um, its relationship to its immediate environment seems to play a part in which behavior will display." }

        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "All right, so let me close today's class with some thoughts to keep in mind while you are doing tonight's assignment. You will be reading one of Ralph Waldo Emerson's best-known essays ‘Self-Reliance' and comparing it with his poems and other works. I think this essay has the potential to be quite meaningful for all of you as young people who probably wonder about things like truth and where your lives are going - all sorts of profound questions." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "Knowing something about Emerson's philosophies will help you when you read ‘Self-Reliance'. And basically, one of the main beliefs that he had was about truth. Not that it's something that we can be taught, Emerson says it's found within ourselves. So this truth, the idea that it's in each one of us, is one of the first points that you'll see Emerson making in this essay." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "It's a bit abstract but he's very into...uh... into each person believing his or her own thought, believing in yourself, the thought or conviction that's true for you." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "But actually, he ties that in with a sort of ‘universal truth' – something that everyone knows but doesn't realize they know. Most of us aren't in touch with ourselves in a way, so we just aren't capable of recognizing profound truth. It takes geniuses, people like, say, Shakespeare, who're unique because when they have a glimpse of this truth, this universal truth, they pay attention to it and express it and don't just dismiss it like most people do." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "So Emerson is really into each individual believing in and trusting him or herself." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "You'll see that he writes about, well, first, conformity. He criticizes that people of his time for abandoning their own minds and their own wills for the sake of conformity and consistency. They try to fit in with the rest of the world even though it's at odds with their beliefs and their identities. Therefore, it's best to be a non-conformist – to do your own thing, not worrying about what other people think. That's an important point. He really drives this argument home throughout the essay." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "When you are reading, I want you to think about that and why that kind of thought would be relevant to the readers of his time. Remember this is 1838, ‘Self-Reliance' was a novel idea at the time and the United State's citizens were less secure about themselves as individuals and as Americans." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "The country as a whole was trying to define itself. Emerson wanted to give people something to really think about, help them find their own way and what it meant to be who they were. So that's something that I think is definitely as relevant today as it was then, probably, um, especially among young adults like yourselves, you know, uh, college being a time to sort of really think about who you are and where you're going." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "Now we already said that Emerson really emphasizes non-conformity, right? As a way to sort of not lose your own self and identity in the world, to have your own truth and not be afraid to listen to it. Well, he takes this a step further. Not conforming also means, uh, not conforming with yourself or your past." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "What does that mean? Well, if you've always been a certain way or done a certain thing, but it's not working for you any more, or you're not content, Emerson says that it'd be foolish to be consistent even with our own past. 'Focus on the future,' he says, 'That's what matters more. Inconsistency is good.'" },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "He talks about a ship's voyage and this is one of the most famous bits of the essay - how the best voyage is made up of zigzag lines. Up close, it seems a little all over the place, but from farther away, the true path shows and in the end it justifies all the turns along the way. So, don't worry if you are not sure where you're headed or what your long-term goals are." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "Stay true to yourself and it'll make sense in the end. I mean, I can attest to that. Before I was a literature professor, I was an accountant. Before that, I was a newspaper reporter. My life is taking some pretty interesting turns and here I am, very happy with my experiences and where they've brought me. If you rely on yourself and trust your own talents, your own interest, don't worry, your path will make sense in the end." }

We’ve been covering rocks and different types of rocks for the last several weeks. But next week we are going to do something a bit different. And to get started I thought I’d mention something that shows how uh…as a geologist, you need to know about more than just rocks and the structure of solid matter. Moving rocks, you may have heard about them. It’s quite a mystery." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "Death valley is this desert plain, a dry lake bed in California surrounded by mountains and on the desert floor these huge rocks, some of them hundreds of pounds. And they move. They leave long trails behind them, tracks you might say as they move from one point to another. But nobody has been able to figure out how they are moving because no one has ever seen it happen." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "Now there are a lot of theories, but all we know for sure is that people aren’t moving the rocks. There are no footprints, no tyre tracks and no heavy machinery like a bulldozer…uh, nothing was ever brought in to move these heavy rocks. So what’s going on?" },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "Theory NO.1 ---Wind. Some researchers think powerful uh…windstorms might move the rocks. Most of the rocks move in the same direction as the dominant wind pattern from southwest to northeast. But some, and this is interesting, move straight west while some zigzag or even move in large circles. Hmmm…How can that be?" },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "How about wind combined with rain? The ground of this desert is made of clay. It’s a desert, so it’s dry. But when there is the occasional rain, the clay ground becomes extremely slippery. It’s hard for anyone to stand on, walk on." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "Some scientists theorized that perhaps when the ground is slippery the high winds can then move the rocks. There’s a problem with this theory. One team of scientists flooded an area of the desert with water, then try to establish how much wind force would be necessary to move the rocks. And get this: you need winds of at least five hundred miles an hour to move just the smallest rocks! And winds that strong have never been recorded. Ever! Not on this planet. So I think it’s safe to say that that issue’s been settled." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "Here is another possibility – ice. It’s possible that rain on the desert floor could turn to thin sheets of ice when temperatures drop at night. So if rocks…uh become embedded in ice, uh … OK, could a piece of ice with rocks in it be pushed around by the wind? But there’s a problem with this theory, too. Rocks trapped in ice together would have moved together when the ice moved. But that doesn’t always happen. The rocks seem to take separate routes." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "There are a few other theories. Maybe the ground vibrates, or maybe the ground itself is shifting, tilting. Maybe the rocks are moved by a magnetic force. But sadly all these ideas have been eliminated as possibilities. There’s just no evidence." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "I bet you are saying to yourself, “well, why don’t scientists just set up video cameras to record what actually happens?” Thing is, this is a protected wilderness area. So by law that type of research isn’t allowed. Besides, in powerful windstorms, sensitive camera equipment would be destroyed." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "So why can’t researchers just live there for a while until they observe the rocks’ moving? Same reason. So where are we now? Well, right now we still don’t have any answers." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "So all this leads back to my main point – you need to know about more than just rocks as geologists. The researchers study in moving rocks. Well, they combine their knowledge of rocks with knowledge of wind, ice and such…uh not successfully, not yet." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "But you know, they wouldn’t even have been able to get started without um… earth science understanding – knowledge about wind, storms, you know, meteorology. You need to understand physics. So for several weeks like I said we’ll be addressing geology from a wider perspective. I guess that’s all for today. See you next time." }

        { "speaker": "Frank", "text": "Well, I guess there wasn’t really any, you know, official government support for the arts until the twentieth century. But the first attempt the United States government made to, you know, to support the arts was the Federal Art Project." },

But then when the United States became involved in the Second World War, unemployment was down and it seems that these programs weren’t really necessary any longer.

        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "It was felt by a number of politicians that …well that the government had a responsibility to support the arts as sort of… oh, what can we say?...the the soul…or spirit of the country. The idea was that there be a federal subsidy…um…uh…financial assistance to artists and artistic or cultural institutions. And for just those reasons, in 1965, the National Endowment for the Arts was created. So it was through the NEA, the National Endowment for the Arts, um…that the arts would develop, would be promoted throughout the nation." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "And then individual states throughout the country started to establish their own state arts councils to help support the arts. There was kind of uh…cultural explosion. And by the mid-1970s, by 1974 I think, all fifty states had their own arts agencies, their own state arts councils that work with the federal government with corporations, artists, performers, you name it." },
        { "speaker": "Frank", "text": "Did you just say corporations? How are they involved?" },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "Well, you see, corporations aren’t always altruistic. They might not support the arts unless…well, unless the government made it attractive for them to do so, by offering corporations tax incentives to support the arts, that is, by letting corporations pay less in taxes if they were patrons of the arts." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "Um, the Kennedy Centre in Washington D.C., you may uh…maybe you’ve been there, or Lincoln Centre in New York. Both of these were built with substantial financial support from corporations. And the Kennedy and Lincoln centers aren’t the only examples. Many of your cultural establishments in the United States will have a plaque somewhere acknowledging the support – the money they received from whatever corporation. Oh, yes, Janet?" },
        { "speaker": "Janet", "text": "But aren’t there a lot of people who don’t think it’s the government’s role to support the arts?" },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "Well, as a matter of fact, a lot of politicians who did not believe in government support for the arts, they wanted to do away with the agency entirely, for that very reason, to get rid of governmental support. But they only succeeded in taking away about half the annual budget. And as far as the public goes, well…there are about as many individuals who disagree with the government support as there are those who agree." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "In fact, with artists in particular, you have lots of artists who support and who have benefited from this agency, although it seems that just as many artists oppose the government agency being involved in the arts, for many different reasons, reasons like they don’t want the government to control what they create. In other words, the arguments both for and against government funding of the arts are as many and, and as varied as the individual styles of the artists who hold them." }

        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "Next, fecundity. Fecundity is the ability to reproduce in large numbers. For example, the common housefly reproduces by laying several thousand eggs, so each fly gene gets copied thousands of times. Memes, well, they can be reproduced in large numbers as well. How many times have you sung the ‘twinkle, twinkle song' to someone? Each time you replicated the song, and maybe passed it along to someone who did not know it yet, a small child maybe." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "And finally, fidelity. Fidelity means accuracy of the copying process. We know fidelity is an essential principle of genetic transmission. If a copy of a gene is a bit different from the original, that's called a genetic mutation. And mutations are usually bad news. An organism often cannot survive with a mutated gene. And so a gene usually cannot be passed on, unless it's an exact copy." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "For memes however, fidelity is not always so important. For example, if you tell someone the alligator story I told you today, it probably won't be word for word exactly as I said it. Still, it will be basically the same story, and the person who hears the story will be able to pass it along. Other memes are replicated with higher fidelity though, like the twinkle, twinkle song." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "It had the exact same words 20 years ago as it does now. Well, that's because we see songs as something that has to be performed accurately each time. If you change a word, the others will usually bring you in line. They'll say, ‘that's not how you sing it', right? So, you can see how looking at pieces of cultural information as replicators, as memes, and analyzing them in terms of longevity, fecundity and fidelity, we can gain some insight about how they spread, persist or change." }

        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "Last week, we covered some arguments against going back to the Moon. But there are compelling reasons in favor of another Moon landing too, um… not the least of which is trying to pinpoint the moon’s age. We could do this in theory by studying an enormous impact crater, known as the South Pole-Aitken Basin. Um…it’s located in the moon’s South Polar Region. But, since it’s on the far side of the moon, it can only be seen from space." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "Here is an image of…we’ll call it the SPA Basin. This color-coated image of the SPA Basin, those aren’t its actual colors obviously, this image is from the mid-90s, from the American spacecraft called Clementine. Um… unlike earlier lunar missions, Clementine didn’t orbit only around the moon’s equator." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "Its orbits enabled it to send back data to create this topographical map of … well, the grey and white area towards the bottom is the South Pole, the purples and blues in the middle correspond to low elevations - the SPA Basin itself, the oranges and reds around it are higher elevations." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "The basin measures an amazing 2,500 km in diameter, and its average depth is 12 km. That makes it the biggest known crater in our solar system and it may well be the oldest. You know planetary researchers love studying deep craters to learn about the impacts that created them, how they redistributed pieces of the planet’s crust." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "And in this case, we especially want to know if any of the mantle, the layer beneath the crust, was exposed by the impact. Not everyone agrees, but some experts are convinced that whatever created the SPA Basin did penetrate the Moon’s mantle. And we need to find out, because much more than the crust, the mantle contains information about a planet’s or Moon’s total composition. And that’s key to understanding planet formation." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "Um…Dian?" },
        { "speaker": "Dian", "text": "So, the only way to know the basin’s age is to study its rocks directly?" },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "Well, from radio survey data, we know that the basin contains lots of smaller craters. So it must be really old, about 4 billion years, give or take a few hundred million years. But that’s not very precise. If we had rock samples to study, we’d know whether these small craters were formed by impacts during the final stages of planetary formation, or if they resulted from later meteor showers." },
        { "speaker": "Dian", "text": "But if we know around how old the Basin is, I’m not sure that’s reason enough to go to the Moon again." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "No…, but such crude estimates…um…we can do better than that. Besides, there’s other things worth investigating, like is there water ice on the moon? Clementine’s data indicated that the wall of the south-polar crater was more reflective than expected. So some experts think there’s probably ice there. Also, data from a later mission indicates significant concentrations of hydrogen and by inference water, less than a meter underground at both poles." },
        { "speaker": "Student", "text": "Well, if there’s water, how did it get there? Underground rivers?" },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "We think meteors that crashed into the moon or tails of passing comets may have introduced water molecules. Any water molecules that found their way to the floors of craters near the moon’s poles, that water would be perpetually frozen, because the floors of those craters are always in shadow. Um…furthermore, if the water ice was mixed in with rock and dust, it would be protected from evaporation." },
        { "speaker": "Dian", "text": "So are you saying there might be primitive life on the moon?" },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "That’s not my point at all. Um… OK, say there is water ice on the moon. That would be of very practical value for a future moon base for astronauts. Water ice could be melted and purified for drinking. It could also be broken down into its component parts - oxygen and hydrogen. Oxygen could be used to breathe, and hydrogen could be turned into fuel, rocket fuel. So water ice could enable the creation of a self-sustaining moon base someday, a mining camp perhaps or a departure point for further space exploration." },
        { "speaker": "Student", "text": "But hauling tons of equipment to the moon to make fuel and build a life support system for a moon base, wouldn’t that be too expensive?" },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "Permanent base, maybe a ways off, but we shouldn’t have to wait for that. The dust at the bottom of the SPA Basin really does have a fascinating story to tell. I wouldn’t give for a few samples of it." }

You know, we have two introductory courses that are supposed to be taken before you get to my course, one in film art, techniques, technical stuff and another in film history. So students in the class you are in should be pretty far along in film studies.

        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "Okay. I know you all have a lot of questions about this lab assignment that's coming out so ... I'm gonna take a little time this morning to discuss it. So, you know the assignment has to do with Spectroscopy, right? And your reading should help you get a good idea of what that's all about. But, let's talk about Spectroscopy a little now just to cover the basics." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "What is Spectroscopy? Well, the simplest definition I can give you is that Spectroscopy is the study of the interaction between matter and light. Now, visible light consists of different colors or wavelengths, which together make up what's called spectrum, a band of colors, like you see in a rainbow." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "And all substances, all forms of matter, can be distinguished according to what wavelength of light they absorb and which ones they reflect. It's like, um, well, every element has, what we call, its own spectral signature. If we can read that signature, we can identify the element. And that's exactly what spectroscopy does." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "Now, Laser Spectroscopy, which is the focus of your assignment, works by measuring very precisely what parts of the spectrum are absorbed by different substances. And it has applications in a lot of different disciplines. And your assignment will be to choose a discipline that interests you, and devise an experiment." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "For example, I'm gonna talk about art. I'm interested in the art and to me it's interesting how spectroscopy is used to analyze art. Let's say a museum curator comes to you with a problem. She's come across this painting that appears to be an original - let's say, a Rembrandt. And she wants to acquire it for her museum. But she's got a problem: she's not absolutely certain it's an original. So, what do you do? How do you determine whether the painting's authentic?" },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "Okay. Think about the scientific process. You've got the question: Is the painting a Rembrandt? So first, you'll need to make a list of characteristics the painting would have to have to be a Rembrandt. Then you have to discover whether the painting in question has those characteristics." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "So first of all, you'll need to know the techniques Rembrandt used when he applied paint to canvas - his brushstrokes, how thickly he applied his paint. So you'd need to work with an art historian who has expert knowledge of Rembrandt's style. You'd have to know when he created his paintings, um... what pigments he used, in other words, what ingredients he used to make different colors of paint, ‘cause the ingredients used in paints and binding agents plus burnishes, finishes, what have you, have changed over time." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "Since you're trying to verify if it's a Rembrandt, the ingredients in the pigment would need to have been used during Rembrandt's lifetime - in the 17th century. And that's where chemistry comes in. You've got to find out what's in those pigments, learn their composition, and that requires lab work - detective work really - in a word, Spectroscopy." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "So, how do we use Spectroscopy? Well, we put an infrared microscope - a spectroscope - on tiny tiny bits of paint. And using ultraviolet light we can see the spectral signature of each component part of the pigment." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "Then we compare these signatures with those of particular elements like zinc or lead, to determine what the pigment was made of. So, you can see why this type of analysis requires a knowledge of the history of pigments, right? How and when they were made?" },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "Say we determined a pigment was made with zinc, for example. We know the spectral signature of zinc. And it matches that of the paint sample. We also know that zinc wasn't discovered until the 18th century. And since Rembrandt lived during the 17th century, we know he couldn't have painted it." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "Now, Spectroscopy has a very distinct advantage over previous methods of analyzing our works, because it's not invasive. You don't have to remove big chips of paint to do your analysis, which is what other methods require. All you do is to train the microscope on tiny flecks of paint and analyze them." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "Now a word or two about restoration. Sometimes original art works appear questionable or inauthentic because they've had so many restorers add touch-up layers to cover up damage, damage from the paint having deteriorated over time. Well, spectroscopy can reveal the composition of those touch-up layers too. So we can find out when they were applied. Then if we want to undo some bad restoration attempts, we can determine what kind of process we can use to remove them to dissolve the paint and uncover the original." }

        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "Now we can't really talk about fairy tales without first talking about folktales because there's a strong connection between these two genres, these two types of stories. In fact, many fairy tales started out as folktales. So, what's a folktale? How would you characterize them? Jeff?" },
        { "speaker": "Jeff", "text": "Well, they are old stories, traditional stories. They were passed down orally within cultures from generation to generation, so they changed a lot over time. I mean, every storyteller, or, maybe every town, might have had a slightly different version of the same folktale." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "That's right. There's local difference. And that's why we say folktales are communal. By communal, we mean they reflect the traits and the concerns of a particular community at a particular time. So essentially the same tale could be told in different communities, with certain aspects of the tale adapted to fit the specific community. Um, not the plot, the details of what happens in the story would remain constant. That was the thread that held the tale together. But all the other elements, like the location or characters, might be modified for each audience." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "Okay. So what about fairy tales? They also are found in most cultures, but how are they different from folktales? I guess the first question is: what is a fairy tale? And don't anyone say 'a story with a fairy in it' because we all know that very few fairy tales actually have those tiny magical creatures in them. But, what else can we say about them? Mary." },
        { "speaker": "Mary", "text": "Well, they seem to be less realistic than folktales... like they have something improbable happening - a frog turning into a prince, say. Oh, that's another common element, royalty - a prince or princess. And fairy tales all seem to take place in a location that's nowhere and everywhere at the same time." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "What's the line-up? How do all those stories start? Once upon a time, in a faraway land... oh, in the case of folktales, each storyteller would specify a particular location and time, though the time and location would differ for different storytellers. With fairy tales, however, the location is generally unspecified, no matter who the storyteller is. That land far away... We'll come back to this point in a few minutes." },
        { "speaker": "Student", "text": "Um... I, I thought that a fairy tale was just a written version of an oral folktale." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "Well, not exactly, though that is how many fairy tales developed. For example, in the late 18th century, the Grimm Brothers traveled throughout what's now Germany, recording local folktales. These were eventually published as fairy tales, but not before undergoing a process of evolution. Now, a number of things happen when an oral tale gets written down." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "First, the language changes. It becomes more formal, more standard - some might say, 'Less colorful'. It's like the difference in your language depending on whether you are talking to someone, or writing them a letter." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "Second, when an orally transmitted story is written down, an authoritative version with a recognized author is created. The communal aspect gets lost. The tale no longer belongs to the community. It belongs to the world, so to speak. Because of this, elements like place and time can no longer be tailored to suit a particular audience. So they become less identifiable, more generalizable to any audience." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "On the other hand, descriptions of characters and settings can be developed more completely. In folktales, characters might be identified by a name, but you wouldn't know anything more about them. But in fairy tales, people no longer have to remember plots. They're written down, right? So more energy can be put into other elements of the story like character and setting." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "So you get more details about the characters, about where the action takes place, what people's houses were like, ur, whether they're small cabins or grand palaces. And it's worth investing that energy because the story, now in book form, isn't in danger of being lost. Those details won't be forgotten. If a folktale isn't repeated by each generation, it may be lost for all time. But with a fairy tale, it's always there in a book, waiting to be discovered, again and again." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "Another interesting difference involves the change in audience. Who the stories are meant for? Contrary to what many people believe today, folktales were originally intended for adults, not for children. So, why is it that fairy tales seem targeted toward children nowadays?" }

And that was it for the year. Eventually, specially-bred multicolored tulips became so valuable. Well, according to records, one tulip bulb was worth 24 tons of wheat, or a thousand pounds of cheese. One particular tulip bulb was sold and exchanged for a small ship. In other words, tulips were literally worth their weight in gold." },

        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "OK, I have an interesting plant species to discuss with you today. Uh…it’s a species of a very rare tree that grows in Australia, Eidothea hardeniana, but it’s better known as the Nightcap Oak." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "Now, it was discovered only very recently, just a few years ago. Um… it remained hidden for so long because it’s so rare. There are only about 200 of them in existence. They grow in a rain forest, in a mountain range…range in the north part of New South Wales which is uh… a state in Australia. So just 200 individual trees in all." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "Now another interesting thing about the Nightcap Oak is that it is…it represents…uh…a very old type…uh…kind of tree that grew a hundred million years ago. Um, we found fossils that old that bear remarkable resemblance to the tree. So, it’s a primitive tree. A…a living fossil you might say. It’s relic from earlier times and it has survived all these years without much change. And it…it’s probably a kind of tree from which other trees that grow in Australia today evolved." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "Just to give you an idea of what we are talking about. Here’s a picture of the leaves of the tree and its flowers. I don’t know how well you can see the flowers. They’re those little clusters sitting at the base of the leaves." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "Okay, what have we tried to find out about the tree since we’ve discovered it? Hmm…or how…why is…is it so rare? It’s one of the first questions. Um… how is it…um…how does it reproduce? It’s another question. Um, maybe those two questions are actually related. Jim?" },
        { "speaker": "Student", "text": "Hmm …I don’t know. But I can imagine that…for instance, seed dispersal might be a factor. I mean if the…er…you know, if the seeds cannot really disperse in the wild area, then, you know, the tree may not colonize new areas. It can’t spread from the area where it’s growing." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "Right. That’s…that’s actually a very good answer. Uh, of course, you might think there might not be many areas where the tree could spread into, er…because…um…well, it’s very specialized in terms of the habitat. But, that’s not really the case here. Um…the suitable habitat, that is, the actual rainforest is much larger than the few hectares where the Nightcap Oak grows" },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "Now this tree is a flowering tree as I showed you. Um…um…it produces a fruit, much like a plum. On the inci…inside there’s a seed with a hard shell. It…it appears that the shell has to crack open or break down somewhat to allow the seed to soak up water. If the Nightcap Oak remains…if their seeds remain locked inside their shell, they will not germinate. Actually, the seeds…er…they don’t retain the power to germinate for very long, maybe two years." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "So there’s actually quite a short window of opportunity for the seed to germinate. So the shell somehow has to be broken down before this…um…germination ability expires. And…and then there’s a kind of rat that likes to feed on the seeds as well. So, given all these limitations, not many seeds that the tree produces will actually germinate. So this is a possible explanation for why the tree does not spread. It doesn’t necessarily explain how it became so rare, but it explains why it doesn’t increase." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "OK, so it seems to be the case that the species, this Nightcap Oak is not very good at spreading. However, it seems, though we can’t be sure, that it’s very good at persisting as a population. Um…we…there’s some indications to suggest that the population of the Nightcap Oak has not declined over the last. er…you know, many hundreds of years." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "So it’s stayed quite stable. It’s not a remnant of some huge population that is dwindled in the last few hundred years for some reason. It’s not necessarily a species in retreat. Ok, so it cannot spread very well, but it’s good at maintaining itself. It’s rare, but it’s not disappearing." },

        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "Alright everybody, the topic for today is, well, we’re gonna take a look at how to start creating the characters for the stories you’re writing. One way of doing that is to come up with what’s called 'a character sketch', I don’t mean a sketch like a drawing, I guess that’s obvious. It’s um…it’s a…a sketch is a way of getting started on defining your characters’ personalities." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "To begin, how do we create fictional characters? We don’t just pull them from thin air, do we? I mean we don’t create them out of nothing. We base them, consciously or unconsciously, we base them on real people, or we blend several people’s traits, their attributes into one character. But when people think fiction, they may assume the characters come from the author’s imagination." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "But the writer’s imagination is influenced by… by real people, could be anyone. So, pay attention to the people you meet: someone in class, at the gym, that guy who is always sitting in the corner at the coffee house, um… your cousin, who’s always getting into dangerous situations. We’re pulling from reality, gathering bits and pieces of real people. You use these people, and the bits of behavior or characteristics as a starting point as you begin to sketch out your characters." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "Here is what you should think about doing first. When you begin to formulate a story, make a list of interesting people you know or have observed. Consider why they’re unique or annoying. Then make notes about their unusual or dominant attributes." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "As you create fictional characters, you’ll almost always combine characteristics from several different people on your list to form the identity and personality of just one character. Keeping this kind of character sketch can help you solidify your character’s personality, so that it remains consistent throughout your story." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "You need to define your characters, know their personalities so that you can have them acting in ways that are predictable, consistent with their personalities. Get to know them like a friend. You know your friends well enough to know how they’ll act in certain situations, right?" },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "Say you have three friends, their car runs out of gas on the highway. John gets upset. Mary remains calm. Teresa takes charge of handling the situation. And let’s say, both John and Mary defer to her leadership. They call you to explain what happen. And when John tells you he got mad, you’re not surprised, because he always gets frustrated when things go wrong. Then he tells you how Teresa took charge, calmed him down, assigned tasks for each person and got them on their way." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "Again, you’re not surprised. It’s exactly what you’d expect. Well, you need to know your characters, like you know your friends. If you know a lot about a person’s character, it’s easy to predict how they’ll behave. So if your characters’ personalities are well defined, it will be easy for you as the writer to portray them realistically…er…believably, in any given situation." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "While writing character sketches, do think about details. Ask yourself questions, even if you don’t use the details in your story. Um…what does each character like to eat, what setting does each prefer, the mountains, the city, what about educational background, their reactions to success or defeat. Write it all down." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "But, here I need to warn you about a possible pitfall. Don’t make your character into a stereotype. Remember the reader needs to know how your character is different from other people who might fall in the same category. Maybe your character loves the mountains and has lived in a remote area for years." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "To make sure he is not a stereotype, ask yourself how he sees life differently from other people who live in that kind of setting. Be careful not to make him into the cliché of the 'ragged mountain dweller'." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "Okay, now, I’ll throw out a little terminology. It’s easy stuff. Major characters are sometimes called 'round characters'. Minor characters are sometimes called, well, just the opposite, 'flat'. A round character is fully developed; a flat character isn’t. Character development is fairly limited. The flat character tends to serve mainly as a motivating factor." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "For instance, you introduce a flat character who has experienced some sort of defeat. And then your round, your main character who loves success and loves to show off, comes and boasts about succeeding and jokes about the flat character’s defeat in front of others, humiliates the other guy. The flat character is introduced solely for the purpose of allowing the round character to show off." }

Um... but basically, you had greenery and you had water." },

        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "Okay, in principle they could, Karl. But the rock paintings aren't the only evidence. Beneath the Sahara are huge aquifers, basically a sea of fresh water, that's perhaps a million years old filtered through rock layers. And...er...and then there is fossilized pollen, from low shrubs and grasses that once grew in the Sahara." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "In fact these plants still grow, er...but hundreds of miles away, in more vegetated areas. Anyway, it's this fossilized pollen along with the aquifers and the rock paintings, these three things are all evidence that the Sahara was once much greener than it is today, that there were hippos and probably elephants and giraffes and so on." },

But that takes the focus away from the natural variations in the earth climate, like the Ice Age, right? The planet was practically covered in ice just a few thousand years ago. Now as far as the Sahara goes, there is some recent literature that points to the migration of the monsoon in that area." },
        { "speaker": "Students", "text": "Huh?????" },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "What do I mean? Okay, a monsoon is a seasonal wind that can bring in a large amount of rainfall. Now if the monsoon migrates, well, that means that the rains move to another area, right?" },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "So what caused the monsoon to migrate? Well, the answer is: the dynamics of earth's motions, the same thing that caused the Ice Age by the way. The earth's not always the same distance from the sun, and it's not always tilting toward the sun at the same angle. There are slight variations in these two parameters. They're gradual variations but their effects can be pretty abrupt. And can cause the climate to change in just a few hundred years." },
        { "speaker": "Student", "text": "That's abrupt?" },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "Well, yeah, considering that other climate shifts take thousands of years, this one is pretty abrupt. So these changes in the planet's motions, they caused the climate to change." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "But it was also compounded. What the Sahara experienced was uh...a sort of 'runaway drying effect'. As I said the monsoon migrated itself, so there was less rain in the Sahara. the land started to get drier, which in turn caused a huge decrease in the amount of vegetation, because vegetation doesn't grow as well in dry soil, right?" },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "And then, less vegetation means the soil can't hold water as well, the soil loses its ability to retain water when it does rain. So then you have less moisture to help clouds form, nothing to evaporate for cloud formation. And then the cycle continues, less rain, drier soil, less vegetation, fewer clouds, less rain etc. etc." },
        { "speaker": "Student", "text": "But, what about the people who made the rock paintings?" },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "Good question. No one really knows. But there might be some connections to ancient Egypt." },
        { "speaker": "Student", "text": "Oh..." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "At about the same time that the Sahara was becoming a desert...hmm ...5,000 years ago, Egypt really began to flourish out in the Nile River valley. And that's not that far away. So it's only logical to hypothesize that a lot of these people migrated to the Nile valley when they realized that this was more than a temporary drought." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "And some people take this a step further. And that's okay, that's science and they hypothesize that this migration actually provided an important impetus in the development of ancient Egypt. Well, we'll stay tuned on that." }

        { "speaker": "professor", "text": "The 19th century was the time that saw what we called Realism developed in the European theater. Um… to understand this though, we first need to look at an earlier form of drama known as the well-made play, which basically was a pattern for constructing plays, plays that... uh.. beginning with some early 19th century comedies in France proved very successful commercially." },
        { "speaker": "professor", "text": "The dramatic devices used here weren’t actually anything new. They had been around for centuries. But the formula for a well-made play required that the certain of these elements be included in a particular order." },
        { "speaker": "professor", "text": "And most importantly, that everything in the play be logically connected. In fact, some of these playwrights would start by writing the end of a play and work backward toward the beginning, just to make sure each event led logically from what had gone before." },
        { "speaker": "professor", "text": "Ok, so what are the necessary elements of a well-made play?" },
        { "speaker": "professor", "text": "Well, the first is logical exposition. Exposition is whatever background information you have to reveal to the audience. So, they‘ll understand what’s going on. Before this time, exposition might have come from actors simply giving speeches. Ur, someone might walk out on a stage and say: 'In fair Verona where we lay our scene!' and then tell all about the feuding families of Romeo and Juliet." },
        { "speaker": "professor", "text": "But for the well-made play, even the exposition had to be logical, believable. So, for example, you might have two servants gossiping as they are cleaning the house. And one says, 'Oh, what a shame the master’s son is still not married.' And the other might mention a rumor about a mysterious gentleman who’s just moved into town with his beautiful daughter. These comments are part of the play’s logical exposition." },
        { "speaker": "professor", "text": "The next key element of a well-made play is referred to as the inciting incident. After we have the background information, we need a key moment that gets things moving, that really makes the audience interested in what happens to the characters we just heard about." },
        { "speaker": "professor", "text": "So, for example, after the two servants reveal all this background information, we meet the young man. Just as he first lays eyes on the beautiful young woman, and immediately falls in love. This is the inciting incident. It sets off the plot of the play." },
        { "speaker": "professor", "text": "Now, the plot of a well-made play is usually driven by secrets. Things that the audience knows, but the characters often don’t know. So, for example, the audience learns through a letter or through someone else’s conversation who this mysterious gentleman is and why he left the town many years before. But the young man doesn’t know about this. And the woman doesn’t understand the ancient connection between her family and his." },
        { "speaker": "professor", "text": "And before the secrets are revealed to the main characters, the plot of the play proceeds as a series of sort of up and down moments. For example, the woman first appears not to even notice the young man, and it seems to him like the end of the world. But then, he learns that she actually wants to meet him, too. So, life is wonderful." },
        { "speaker": "professor", "text": "Then, if he tries to talk with her, maybe her father gets furious, for no apparent reason. So, they can’t see each other. But, just as the young man has almost lost all hope, he finds out, well you get the idea, the reversals of fortune continue, increasing the audience’s tension and excitement, making them wonder if everything is going to come out okay or not." },
        { "speaker": "professor", "text": "Next comes an element known as the: obligatory scene. It’s a scene, a moment in which all the secrets are revealed. And generally, things turn out well for the hero and others we care about, a happy ending of some sort. This became so popular that a playwright almost had to include it in every play, which is why it’s called: the obligatory scene." },
        { "speaker": "professor", "text": "And that’s followed by the final dramatic element — the denouement or the resolution, when all the loose ends have to be tied up in a logical way. Remember, the obligatory scene gives the audience emotional pleasure. But the denouement offers the audience a logical conclusion. That’s the subtle distinction we need to try very hard to keep in mind." },
        { "speaker": "professor", "text": "So, as I said, the well-made play, this form of playwriting, became the basis for realism in drama, and for a lot of very popular 19th-century plays. And also, a pattern we find in the plots of many later plays and even movies that we see today." }

And then, they analyze the echoes, how the waves bounce back. Here, let me finish this diagram I started before class. So the bat sends out these pulses, very focused bursts of sound, and echoes bounce back. You know, I don’t think I need to draw on the echoes. Your reading assignment for the next class, it has a diagram that shows this very clearly." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "So, anyway, as I were saying, by analyzing these echoes, the bat can determine, say, if there is wall in a cave that it needs to avoid, and how far away it is. Another thing it uses ultrasound to detect is the size and shape of objects. For example, one echo they quickly identify is the one they associate with a moth, which is common prey for a bat, particularly a moth beating its wings." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "However, moth happened to have a major advantage over most other insects. They can detect ultrasound; this means that when a bat approaches, the moth can detect the bat’s presence. So, it has time to escape to safety, or else they can just remain motionless. Since, when they stop beating their wings, they’d be much harder for the bat to distinguish from, oh… a leaf or some other object." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "Now, we have tended to underestimate just how sophisticated the abilities of animals that use ultrasound are. In fact, we kind of assumed that they were filtering a lot out, the way a sophisticated radar system can ignore echoes from stationary objects on the ground. Radar does this to remove ground clutter, information about hills or buildings that it doesn’t need." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "But bats, we thought they were filtering out this kind of information, because they simply couldn’t analyze it. But, it looks as if we were wrong. Recently there was this experiment with trees and a specific species of bats. A bat called: the lesser spear-nosed bat." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "Now, a tree should be a huge acoustical challenge for a bat, right? I mean it’s got all kinds of surfaces with different shapes and angles. So, well, the echoes from a tree are going to a mass of chaotic acoustic reflections, right, not like the echo from a moth." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "So, we thought for a long time that bats stop their evaluation at simply that is a tree. Yet, it turns out that bats or at least this particular species, cannot only tell that is a tree, but can also distinguish between, say, a pine tree, and a deciduous tree, like a maple or oak tree, just by their leaves. And when I say, leaves, I mean pine needles too. Any ideas on how it would know that?" },
        { "speaker": "STUDENT", "text": "Well, like with the moth, could it be their shape?" },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "You are on the right track — It is actually the echo of all the leaves as whole that matters. Now, think, a pine tree with all those little densely packed needles. Those produce a large number of faint reflections in what’s... what’s called a ... a smooth echo." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "The wave form is very even, but an oak which has fewer but bigger leaves with stronger reflections, produces a jagged wave form, or what we called: a rough echo. And these bats can distinguish between the two, and not just with trees, but with any echo that comes in a smooth or rough shape." }

        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "So we've been discussing 16th century Native American life, and today we are gonna focus on the Iroquois and Huron peoples. They lived in the northeastern great lakes region of North America. Now, back then, their lives depended on the natural resources of the forests, especially the birch tree. The birch tree can grow in many different types of soils and is prevalent in that area. Now can anyone here describe a birch tree?" },
        { "speaker": "Student", "text": "Um, they are tall and white, the bark, I mean." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "Yes. The birch tree has white bark, and this tough protective outer layer of the tree, this white bark, is waterproof. And this waterproof quality of the bark, it made it useful for making things like cooking containers, a variety of utensils. And if you peel birch bark in the winter, we call it 'the winter bark', another layer, a tougher inner layer of the tree adheres to the bark, producing a stronger material. So the winter bark was used for larger utensils and containers." },
        { "speaker": "Student", "text": "I know people make utensils out of wood, but utensils out of tree bark?" },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "Well, birch bark is pliable and very easy to bend. The Native Americans would cut the bark and fold it into any shape they needed, then secure it with cords until it dried. They could fold the bark into many shapes." },
        { "speaker": "Student", "text": "So if they cooked in bowls made of birch bark, wouldn't that make the food taste funny?" },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "Oh, that's one of the great things about birch bark. The taste of the birch tree doesn't get transferred to the food. So it was perfect for cooking containers. But the most important use of the bark, by far, was the canoe. Since the northeast region of North America is interconnected by many streams and waterways, water transportation by vessels like a canoe was most essential. The paths through the woods were often overgrown, so water travel was much faster. And here's what the Native Americans did. They would peel large sheets of bark from the tree to form lightweight yet sturdy canoes. The bark was stretched over frames made from tree branches, stitched together and sealed with resin. You know that sticky liquid that comes out of the tree? And when it dries, it's watertight." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "One great thing about these birch bark canoes was, uh, they could carry a large amount of cargo. For example, a canoe weighing about 50 pounds could carry up to nine people and 250 pounds of cargo." },
        { "speaker": "Student", "text": "Wow! But how far could they travel that way?" },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "Well like I said, the northeastern region is interconnected by rivers and streams and the ocean at the coast. The canoes allow them to travel over a vast area that today would take a few hours to fly over. You see, the Native Americans made canoes of all types, for travel on small streams or on large open ocean waters. For small streams, they made narrow, maneuverable boats, while larger canoes were needed for the ocean. They could travel throughout the area only occasionally having to portage, to carry the canoe over a land short distance to another nearby stream. And since the canoes were so light, this wasn't a difficult task. Now how do you think this affected their lives?" },
        { "speaker": "Student", "text": "Well if they could travel so easily over such a large area, they could trade with people from other areas which I guess would lead them to form alliances?" },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "Exactly. Having an efficient means of transportation, well, that helps the Iroquois to form a federation linked by natural waterways. And this federation expanded from what is now Southern Canada all the way south to the Delaware River. And this efficiency of the birch bark canoe also made an impression on newcomers to the area. French traders in the 17th century modeled their... well, they adopted the design of the Iroquois birch bark canoes, and they found they could travel great distances more than 1500 kilometers a month." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "Now besides the bark, Native Americans also used the wood of the birch tree. The young trees were used as supports for lodgings, with the waterproof bark used as roofing. Branches were folded into snowshoes. And the Native American people were all adept at running very fast over the snow in these birch branch snowshoes, which if you ever tried walking in snowshoes you know it wasn't easy." }

        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "Last time, we started to talk about glaciers and how these masses of ice form from crystallized snow, and some of you were amazed at how huge some of these glaciers are. Now, even though it may be difficult to understand how a huge mass of ice can move or flow, it’s another word for it, it’s really no secret that the glaciers flow because of gravity. But how they flow, the way they flow, needs some explaining." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "Now, the first type of glacier flow is called: basal slip. Basal slip or sliding as it’s often called, basically refers to the slipping or sliding of a glacier across bedrock, actually across a thin layer of water on top of the bedrock. So, this process shouldn’t be too hard to imagine. What happens is that the ice at the base of the glacier is under a great deal of pressure – the pressure coming from the weight of the overlying ice." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "And you probably know that under pressure, the melting temperature of water, of the ice I mean, is reduced. So, ice at the base of the glacier melts, even though it’s below zero degree Celsius. And this results in a thin layer of water between the glacier and the ground. This layer of water reduces friction is... is like a lubricant. And it allows the glacier to slide or slip over the bedrock. OK?" },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "Now the next type of movement we will talk about is called: deformation. You’ve already known that ice is brittle, if you hit it with a hammer, it will shatter like glass. But ice is also plastic, it can change shape without breaking. If you leave, for example, a bar of ice supported only at one end, the end, the unsupported end will deform under its own weight." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "It’ll kind of flatten out at one end, get distorted, deformed. Think of deformation as a very slow oozing. Depending on the stresses on the glacier, the ice crystals within it reorganize. And during this re-organization the ice crystals realign in a way that allows them to slide past each other. And so the glacier oozes downhill without any ice actually melting." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "Now, there are a couple of factors that affect the amount of deformation that takes place or the speed of the glacier’s movement for example. Deformation is more likely to occur the thicker the ice is, because of the gravity of the weight of the ice." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "And temperature also plays a part here, in that cold ice does not move as easily as ice that is close to the melting point. In fact, it is not too different from… the way oil is, thicker at lower temperatures. So, if you have a glacier in a slightly warmer region, it will flow faster than a glacier in a cooler region." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "Ok, um… Now, I’d like to touch briefly on extension and compression. Your textbook includes these as types, as a particular type of glacier movement, but you will see that there are …as many textbooks that omit it as a type of movement as include it. And I might not include it right now, if it weren’t in your textbook." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "But, basically, the upper parts of glaciers have less pressure on them. So, they don’t deform easily, they tend to be more brittle. And crevasses can form in these upper layers of the glacier. When the glacier comes into contact with bedrock walls or is otherwise under some kind of stress, but can’t deform quickly enough." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "So, the ice would expand or constrict, and that can cause big fissures, big cracks to form in the surface layers of the ice, and that brittle surface ice moving is sometimes considered a type of glacier movement depending on which source you are consulting." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "Now, as you probably know, glaciers generally move really slowly. But sometimes, they experience surges, and during these surges, in some places, they can move at speeds as high as 7000 meters per year. Now, speeds like that are pretty unusual, hundreds of times faster than the regular movement of glaciers, but you can actually see glaciers move during these surges, though it is rare." }

They are dispersed by some other agent, like the wind. And if the seeds land in a suitable habitat, they do well and reproduce." },
        { "speaker": "Pro", "text": "With active habitat selection, an organism is able to physically select where to live and breed. And because an animal's breeding habitat is so important, we'd expect animal species to have developed preferences for particular types of habitats, places where their offspring have the best chance of survival. So let's look at the effect this preference can have by looking at some examples. But first let's recap. What do we mean by habitat? Frank?" },

        { "speaker": "Pro", "text": "Right, and as we've discussed, there are some key elements that a habitat must contain – food obviously, water and it's got to have the right climate and spaces for physical protection. And we saw how important habitat selection is when we look at habitats where some of these factors are removed, perhaps through habitat destruction. Um, I just read about a shorebird, the plover." },
        { "speaker": "Pro", "text": "The plover lives by the ocean and feeds on small shellfish, insects and plants. It blends in with the sand, so it's well-camouflaged from predator birds above. But it lays its eggs in shallow depressions in the sand with very little protection around them. So if there are people or dogs on the beach, the eggs and fledglings in the nests are really vulnerable." },
        { "speaker": "Pro", "text": "Out in California where there has been a lot of human development by the ocean, the plovers are now a threatened species. So conservationists tried to recreate a new habitat for them. They made artificial beaches and sand bars in areas inaccessible to people and dogs. And the plover population is up quite a bit in those places." },
        { "speaker": "Pro", "text": "Ok. That is an instance where a habitat is made less suitable. But now, what about cases where an animal exhibits a clear choice between two suitable habitats? In cases like that, does the preference matter? Well, Let's look at the blue warbler." },
        { "speaker": "Pro", "text": "The Blue warbler is a songbird that lives in North America. They clearly prefer hard wood forests with dense shrubs, bushes underneath the trees. They actually nest in the shrubs, not the trees. So they're pretty close to the ground, but these warblers also nest in forests that have low shrub density. It is usually the younger warblers that nest in these areas because the preferred spots where there are a lot of shrubs are taken by the older, more dominant birds." },
        { "speaker": "Pro", "text": "And the choice of habitat seems to affect reproductive success. Because the older, more experienced birds who nest in the high density shrub areas have significantly more offspring than those in low density areas, which suggests that the choice of where to nest does have an impact on the number of chicks they have." },
        { "speaker": "Pro", "text": "But a preferred environment doesn't always seem to correlate with greater reproductive success. For example, In Europe, studies have been done of blackcap warblers. We just call them blackcaps." },
        { "speaker": "Pro", "text": "The Blackcap can be found in two different environments. Their preferred habitat is forests near the edge of streams. However, blackcaps also live in pine woods away from water. Studies have been done on the reproductive success rates for the birds in both areas, and the result showed surprisingly that the reproductive success was essentially the same in both areas – the preferred and the second choice habitat. Well. Why?" },
        { "speaker": "Pro", "text": "It turned out that there were actually four times as many bird pairs or couples living in the stream edge habitat compared to the area away from the stream. So this stream edge area had a much denser population, which meant more members of the same species competing for resources, wanting to feed on the same things or build their nests in the same places, which lower the suitability of the prime habitat even though it's their preferred habitat." },
        { "speaker": "Pro", "text": "So the results of the study suggest that when the number of the competitors in the prime habitat reaches a certain point, the second rank habitat becomes just as successful as the prime habitat, just because there are fewer members of the same species living there. So it looks like competition for resources is another important factor in determining if a particular habitat is suitable." }

        { "speaker": "Pro", "text": "So, we've been talking about the printing press, how it changed people's lives, making books more accessible to everyone. More books meant more reading, right? But, as you know, not everyone has perfect vision. This increase in literacy, um, in reading, led to an increase in demand for eyeglasses. And here's something you probably haven't thought of. This increased demand impacted societal attitudes towards eyeglasses." },
        { "speaker": "Pro", "text": "But, first let me back up a bit and talk about vision correction before the printing press. And, um, what did people with poor vision do, I mean, especially those few people who were actually literate? What did they do before glasses were invented? Well, they had different ways of dealing with not seeing well." },
        { "speaker": "Pro", "text": "If you think about it, poor vision wasn't their only problem. I mean, um, think about the conditions they lived in: houses were dark; sometimes there weren't any windows; candles were the only source of light. So, in some places, um, like ancient Greece, for example, the wealthiest people with poor vision could have someone else read to them – easy solution if you could afford it." },
        { "speaker": "Pro", "text": "Another solution was something called a 'reading stone'. Around 1000 C.E., European monks would take a piece of clear rock, often quartz, and place it on top of the reading material. The clear rock magnified the letters, making them appear larger. Um, well, it's like what happens when a drop of water falls on something. Whatever's below the drop of water appears larger, right? Well, the 'reading stone' works in a similar way." },
        { "speaker": "Pro", "text": "But rocks like quartz, well, quartz of optical quality weren't cheap. Late in the 13th century, glass makers in Italy came up with a less expensive alternative. They made reading stones out of clear glass. And these clear glass reading stones evolved into the eyeglasses we know today. So we're pretty sure that glasses were invented about the late 1200's, well, over a hundred years before the printing press." },
        { "speaker": "Pro", "text": "But it's not clear who exactly invented them first or exactly what year. But record showed that they were invented in both Europe and China at about the same time. By the way, we call this 'independent discovery'. Independent discovery means when something is invented in different parts of the world at the same time and it's not as unusual as it sounds. You can look at the timeline charts in the back of your textbook to see when things were invented in different cultures at about the same time to see what I'm talking about." },
        { "speaker": "Pro", "text": "So now let's tie this to what I've said before about societal attitudes towards glasses. Initially, in parts of Europe and in China, glasses were a symbol of wisdom and intelligence. This is evident in the artwork from the period. European paintings often portrayed doctors or judges wearing glasses. In China, glasses were very expensive." },
        { "speaker": "Pro", "text": "So in addition to intelligence, they also symbolize affluence, um, wealth. In 14th-century Chinese portraits, the bigger the glasses, the smarter and wealthier the subject was. So glasses were a status symbol in some parts of the world." },

So the need, oh well, actually not only the need but the demand for more affordable glasses rose drastically. Eventually, inexpensive glasses were produced, and then glasses were available to everyone. People could purchase them easily from a traveling peddler." }

        { "speaker": "Stu", "text": "Yes, um, Professor Harrison, you were saying that the periodic table is predictive. What exactly does that mean? I mean I understand how it organizes the elements, but where's the prediction?" },
        { "speaker": "Pro", "text": "Ok, let's look at our periodic table again. Ok, it groups elements into categories that share certain properties, right?" },
        { "speaker": "Stu", "text": "Uh-huh." },
        { "speaker": "Pro", "text": "And it is arranged according to increasing atomic number, which is..." },
        { "speaker": "Stu", "text": "The number of protons in each atom of an element." },
        { "speaker": "Pro", "text": "Right. Well, early versions of the periodic table had gaps, missing elements. Every time you had one more proton, you had another element. And then, oops, there'd be an atomic number, for which there was no known element. And the prediction was that an element with that atomic number existed somewhere, but it just hadn't been found yet. And its location in the table would tell you what properties it should have. It was really pretty exciting for scientists at that time to find these missing elements and confirm their predictive properties." },
        { "speaker": "Pro", "text": "Um, actually, that reminds me of a ... of a very good example of all these, element 43. See on the table, the symbols for elements 42 and 44. Well, in early versions of the table, there was no symbol for an element 43 protons because no element with 43 protons had been discovered yet. So the periodic table had a gap between elements 42 and 44." },
        { "speaker": "Pro", "text": "And then in 1925, a team of chemists led by a scientist named Ida Tacke claimed that they had found element 43. They had been using a relatively new technology called X-ray spectroscopy, and they were using this to examine an ore sample. And they claimed that they'd found an element with 43 protons. And they named it Masurium." },

X-ray spectroscopy was a new method at that time. And they were never able to isolate enough Masurium to have a weighable sample to convince everyone of the discovery. So they were discredited. But then, 12 years later in 1937, a different team became the first to synthesize an element using a cyclotron. And that element had..." },
        { "speaker": "Stu", "text": "43 protons?" },
        { "speaker": "Pro", "text": "That's right, but they named it Technetium to emphasize that it was artificially created with technology. And people thought that synthesizing this element, making it artificially was the only way to get it. We still hadn't found it occurring in nature. Now element 43, whether you call it Masurium or Technetium, is radioactive. Why does that matter? What is true of a radioactive element?" },
        { "speaker": "Stu", "text": "It decays, it turns into other elements. Oh, so does that explain why it was missing in the periodic table?" },
        { "speaker": "Pro", "text": "Exactly, because of its radioactive decay, element 43 doesn't last very long. And therefore, if that ever had been present on Earth, it would have decayed ages ago. So the Masurium people were obviously wrong, and the Technetium people were right. Right? Well, that was then." },
        { "speaker": "Pro", "text": "Now we know that element 43 does occur naturally. It can be naturally generated from Uranium atoms that have spontaneously split. And guess what, the ore sample the Masurium group was working with had plenty of Uranium in it, enough to split into measurable amounts of Masurium. So Tacke's team might very well have found small amounts of Masurium in the ore samples. It's just that once it was generated from split Uranium, it decayed very quickly." },
        { "speaker": "Pro", "text": "And you know here's an incredible irony. Ida Tacke, the chemist who led the Masurium team, well, she was the first to suggest that Uranium could break up into smaller pieces, but she didn't know that that was the defense of her own discovery of element 43." },
        { "speaker": "Stu", "text": "So is my version of the periodic table wrong? Should element 43 really be called Masurium?" },
        { "speaker": "Pro", "text": "Maybe, but you know it's hard to tell for sure after all this time, if Ida Tacke's group did discover element 43. They didn't, um, publish enough detail on their methods or instruments for us to know for sure." },
        { "speaker": "Pro", "text": "But I'd like to think element 43 was discovered twice. As Masurium, it was the first element discovered that occurs in nature only from spontaneous fission, and as Technetium, it was the first element discovered in a laboratory. And of course, it was an element the periodic table led us to expect existed before anyone had found it or made it." }

        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "As we have seen, the second half of the 18th century was an exciting time in Europe: it was not only an age of great invention, but social changes also led to a rise in all sorts of entertainment, from reading to museums, to travel. And finding himself in the middle of this excitement was an accomplished French painter named Philippe Jacques de Loutherbourg." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "Loutherbourg arrived in England in 1771, and immediately went to work as a set designer at the famous Drury Lane Theater in London. From his first shows, Loutherbourg showed a knack for imagination and stage design, all in the interest of creating illusions that allowed the audience to suspend disbelief completely. He accomplished this by giving the stage a greater feeling of depth, which he did by cutting up some of the rigid background scenery, and placing it at various angles and distances from the audience." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "Another realistic touch was using three-dimensional objects on the set, like rocks and bushes as opposed to two-dimensional painted scenery. He also paid much more attention to lighting and sound than had been done before." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "Now, these sets were so elaborate that many people attended the theater more for them than for the actors or the story. At the time, people were wild for travel and for experiencing new places; but not everyone could afford it. Loutherbourg outdid himself, however, with a show that he set up in his own home. He called it the 'Eidophusikon'." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "'Eidophusikon' means something like representation of nature, and that's exactly what he intended to do: create realistic moving scenes that change before the audiences' eyes. In this, he synthesized all his tricks from Drury Lane: mechanical motions, sound, light, other special effects to create, if you will, an early multimedia production." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "The 'Eidophusikon' was Loutherbourg's attempt to release painting from the constraints of the picture frame. After all, even the most action-filled exciting painting can represent only one moment in time; and any illusion of movement is gone after the first glance. But Loutherbourg, like other contemporary painters, wanted to add the dimension of time to his paintings." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "You know, the popular thinking is that Loutherbourg was influenced by landscape painting. But why can't we say that the 'Eidophusikon' actually influenced the painters? At the very least we have to consider that it was more ... it was more of a mutual thing. We know, for example, that the important English landscape painter, Thomas Gainsborough, attended almost all of the early performances, and his later paintings are notable for their increased color and dynamic use of light." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "Loutherbourg's influence on the theater though, he was incredibly influential. The way he brought together design and lighting and sound as a unified feature of the stage can easily be seen in English theater's subsequent emphasis on lighting and motion." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "Now, the 'Eidophusikon' stage was actually a box: a few meters wide, a couple meters tall and a couple meters deep. That is, the action took place within this box. This was much smaller of course than the usual stage. But, it also allowed Loutherbourg to concentrate the lighting to better effect." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "Also, the audience was in the dark, which wouldn't be a common feature of the theater until a hundred years later. The show consisted of a series of scenes. For example, a view of London from sunrise that changes as the day moves on; mechanical figures, such as cattle, moved across the scene, and ships sailed along the river." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "But what really got people was the attention to detail, much like his work at Drury Lane. So, for example, he painted very realistic ships, and varied their size depending on their distance from the audience. Small boats moved more quickly across the foreground than larger ones did that were closer to the horizon. Other effects, like waves, were also very convincing. They reflected sunlight or moonlight depending on the time of day or night. Even the colors changed as they would in nature." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "Sound and light were important in making his productions realistic. He used a great number of lamps, and he was able to change colors of light by using variously colored pieces of glass, to create effects like passing clouds that suddenly change in color. Furthermore, he used effects to make patterns of shadow and light, rather than using the uniform lighting that was common at the time. And many of the sound effects he pioneered are still in use today, like creating thunder by pulling on one of the corners of a thin copper sheet." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "One of his most popular scenes was of a storm. And there is a story that on one occasion, an actual storm passed over head during the show. And some people went outside, and they claimed Loutherbourg's thunder was actually better than the real thunder." }

Shrubs are increasing in the 'tundra'. Tundra is flat land with very little vegetation." },
        { "speaker": "Lecturer", "text": "Just a few species of plants grow there because the temperature is very cold, and there's not much precipitation. And because of the cold temperatures, the tundra has two layers: top layer, which is called the active layer, is frozen in the winter and spring, but thaws in the summer. Beneath this active layer is a second layer called 'permafrost', which is frozen all year around, and is impermeable to water." },
        { "speaker": "Female_Student", "text": "So because of the permafrost, none of the plants that grow there can have deep roots, can they?" },
        { "speaker": "Lecturer", "text": "No, and that's one of the reasons that shrubs survive in the Arctic. Shrubs are little bushes. They're not tall and being low to the ground protects them from the cold and wind. And their roots don't grow very deep, so the permafrost doesn't interfere with their growth. OK? Now since the temperatures have been increasing in Arctic Alaska, the growth of shrubs has increased. And this has presented climate scientists with a puzzle..." },
        { "speaker": "Male_Student", "text": "I'm sorry, when you say the growth of shrubs has increased, do you mean that the shrubs are bigger, or that there are more shrubs?" },
        { "speaker": "Lecturer", "text": "Good question! And the answer is both. The size of the shrubs has increased and shrub cover has spread to what was previously shrub-free tundra. Ok, so what's the puzzle? Warmer temperatures should lead to increased vegetation growth, right? Well, the connection is not so simple." },
        { "speaker": "Lecturer", "text": "The temperature increase has occurred during the winter and spring, not during the summer. But the increase in shrubs has occurred in the summer. So how can increase temperatures in the winter and spring result in increased shrub growth in the summer? Well, it may be biological processes that occur in the soil in the winter, that cause increased shrub growth in the summer, and here's how: there are 'microbes', microscopic organisms that live in the soil." },
        { "speaker": "Lecturer", "text": "These microbes enable the soil to have more nitrogen, which plants need to live and they remain quite active during the winter. There're two reasons for this: first, they live in the active layer, which, remember, contains water that doesn't penetrate the permafrost." },
        { "speaker": "Lecturer", "text": "Second, most of the precipitation in the Arctic is in the form of snow. And the snow, which blankets the ground in the winter, actually has an insulating effect on the soil beneath it. And it allows the temperature of the soil to remain warm enough for microbes to remain active. So there's been increased nutrient production in the winter. And that's what's responsible for the growth of shrubs in the summer and their spread to new areas of the tundra. Areas with more new nutrients are the areas with the largest increase in shrubs." },
        { "speaker": "Female_Student", "text": "But, what about run-off in the spring, when the snow finally melts? Won't the nutrients get washed away? Spring thaw always washes away soil, doesn't it?" },
        { "speaker": "Lecturer", "text": "Well, much of the soil is usually still frozen during peak run-off. And the nutrients are deep down in the active layer anyway, not high up near the surface, which is the part of the active layer most affected by run-off. But as I was about to say, there's more to the story. The tundra is windy, and the snow is blown across the tundra, it's caught by shrubs. And deep snow drifts often form around shrubs." },
        { "speaker": "Lecturer", "text": "And we've already mentioned the insulating effect of snow. So that extra warmth means even more microbial activity, which means even more food for the shrubs, which means even more shrubs and more snow around etc.. It's a circle, a loop. And because of this loop, which is promoted by warmer temperatures in winter and spring, well, it looks like the tundra may be turning into shrub land." },
        { "speaker": "Female_Student", "text": "But will it be long-term? I mean maybe the shrubs will be abundant for a few years, and then it'll change back to tundra." },
        { "speaker": "Lecturer", "text": "Well, shrub expansion has occurred in other environments, like semiarid grassland, and tall grass prairies. And shrub expansion in these environments does seem to persist, almost to the point of causing a shift. Once is established, shrub land thrives, particularly in the Arctic, because Arctic shrubs are good at taking advantage of increased nutrients in the soil, better than other Arctic plants." }

        { "speaker": "Lecturer", "text": "So, continuing our discussion of desert lakes, now I want to focus on what's known as the 'Empty Quarter'. The 'Empty Quarter' is a huge area of sand that covers about a quarter of the Arabian Peninsula. Today it's pretty desolate, barren and extremely hot." },
        { "speaker": "Lecturer", "text": "But there've been times in the past when monsoon rains soaked the Empty Quarter and turned it from a desert into grassland that was dotted with lakes and home to various animals. There were actually two periods of rain and lake formation: the first one began about 37,000 years ago; and the second one dates from about 10,000 years ago." },
        { "speaker": "Female_Student", "text": "Excuse me, Professor. But I'm confused. Why would lakes form in the desert? It's just sand, after all." },
        { "speaker": "Lecturer", "text": "Good question! We know from modern day desert lakes, like Lake Eyre in South Australia, that under the right conditions, lakes do form in the desert. But the Empty Quarter lakes disappeared thousands of years ago. They left behind their beds or basins as limestone formations that we can still see today. They look like low-lying, white or grey buttes, long, narrow hills with flat tops, barely a meter high." },
        { "speaker": "Lecturer", "text": "A recent study of some of the formations presents some new theories about the area's past. Keep in mind though that this study only looked at 19 formations. And about a thousand have been documented. So there's a lot more work to be done." },
        { "speaker": "Lecturer", "text": "According to the study, two factors were important for lake formation in the Empty Quarter: first, the rains that fell there were torrential. So it would've been impossible for all the water to soak into the ground. Second, as you know, sand dunes contain other types of particles, besides sand, including clay and silt." },
        { "speaker": "Lecturer", "text": "Now, when the rain fell, water ran down the sides of the dunes, carrying clay and silt particles with it. And wherever these particles settled, they formed a pan, a layer that water couldn't penetrate. Once this pan formed, further run-off collected, and formed a lake." },
        { "speaker": "Lecturer", "text": "Now, the older lakes, about half the formations, the ones that started forming 37,000 years ago, the limestone formations we see, they're up to a kilometer long, but only a few meters wide, and they're scattered along the desert floor, in valleys between the dunes." },
        { "speaker": "Lecturer", "text": "So, the theory is, the lakes formed there on the desert floor, in these long narrow valleys. And we know, because of what we know about similar ancient desert lakes, we know that the lakes didn't last very long, from a few months to a few years on average. As for the more recent lakes, the ones from 10,000 years ago, well, they seemed to have been smaller, and so may have dried up more quickly." },
        { "speaker": "Lecturer", "text": "Another difference, very important today for distinguishing between older lake beds and newer ones, is the location of the limestone formations. The more recent beds are high up in the dunes. Why these differences? Well, there are some ideas about that, and they have to do with the shapes of the sand dunes, when the lakes were formed." },
        { "speaker": "Lecturer", "text": "37,000 years ago, the dunes were probably nicely rounded at the top, so the water just ran right down their sides to the desert floor. But there were thousands of years of wind between the two rainy periods, reshaping the dunes. So, during the second rainy period, the dunes were kind of chopped up at the top, full of hollows and ridges, and these hollows would've captured the rain right there on the top." },
        { "speaker": "Lecturer", "text": "Now, in a grassland of Lake Ecosystem, we'd expect to find fossils from a variety of animals, and numerous fossils have been found at least at these particular sites. But, where did these animals come from? Well, the theory that has been suggested is that they migrated in from nearby habitats where they were already living. Then as the lakes dried up, they died out." },
        { "speaker": "Lecturer", "text": "The study makes a couple of interesting points about the fossils, which I hope will be looked at in future studies. At older lake sites, there’s fossil remains from hippopotamuses, water buffalo, animals that spend much of their lives standing in water, and also, fossils of cattle." },
        { "speaker": "Lecturer", "text": "However, at the sites of the more recent lakes, there’s only cattle fossils, additional evidence for geologists that these lakes were probably smaller, shallower, because cattle only use water for drinking. So they survive on much less. Interestingly, there are clams and snail shells; but, no fossils of fish. We're not sure why. Maybe there was a problem with the water. Maybe it was too salty. That's certainly true of other desert lakes." }

        { "speaker": "Lecturer", "text": "Of course, that's a fair question. OK, well, to start with, let's make it clear that language is a type of communication, not the other way around. OK, so all communication systems, language included, have certain features in common. For example, the signals used to communicate from the bee's dance movements, to the word and sentences found in human languages." },
        { "speaker": "Lecturer", "text": "All these signals convey meaning. And all communication systems serve a purpose, a pragmatic function of some sort–warning of danger perhaps or offering other needed information. But there're several features peculiar to human language that have, for the most part, never been found in the communication system of any other species." },
        { "speaker": "Lecturer", "text": "For one thing, learn ability. Animals have instinctive communication systems. When a dog, a puppy gets to certain age, it's able to bark. It barks without having to learn how from other dogs, it just barks. But much of human language has to be learned from other humans." },

You know, like nouns, to name the type of predator they spotted, adjectives to describe its size and shape, verbs..., but now it seems like..." },
        { "speaker": "Lecturer", "text": "All right, hold on a moment. I'm familiar with the study you're talking about. And for those of you who don't know, prairie dogs are not actually dogs. They're a type of rodent who, who burrow in the ground, in the grasslands of the western United States and Mexico." },
        { "speaker": "Lecturer", "text": "In this study, the researchers looked at the high-pitched barks a prairie dog makes when it spots predator. And from this they made some pretty.., well, they made some claims about these calls qualifying as an actual language, with its own primitive grammar. But actually, these warning calls are no different from those found among certain types of monkeys. And, well, let's not even get into the question of whether concepts like noun and verb can be meaningfully applied to animal communication." },
        { "speaker": "Lecturer", "text": "Another thing that distinguishes a real language is a property we call 'discreteness'. In other words, messages are built up out of smaller parts, sentences out of words, words out of individual sounds, etc." },
        { "speaker": "Lecturer", "text": "Now maybe you could say that the prairie dog's message is built from smaller parts. Like say for example, our prairie dog spots a predator, a big coyote approaching rapidly. So the prairie dog makes a call that means 'coyote', then one that means 'large', and then another one to indicate its speed. But do you really suppose it makes any difference what order these calls come in? No." },
        { "speaker": "Lecturer", "text": "But the discrete units that make up language can be put together in different ways. Those smaller parts can be used to form an infinite number of messages, including messages that are completely novel, that have never been expressed before." },
        { "speaker": "Lecturer", "text": "For example, we can differentiate between: 'A large coyote moves fast.' and say 'Move the large coyote fast.' or 'Move fast, large coyote.', and I truly doubt whether anyone has ever uttered either of these sentences before. Human language is productive, an open-ended communication system, whereas no other communication system has this property." },
        { "speaker": "Lecturer", "text": "And another feature of language that's not displayed by any form of animal communication is what we call 'displacement'. That is, language is abstract enough that we can talk about things that aren't present here and now." },
        { "speaker": "Lecturer", "text": "Things like 'My friend Joe is not in the room.' or 'It will probably rain next Thursday.' Prairie dogs may be able to tell you about a hawk that’s circling overhead right now, but they never show any inclination to describe the one they saw last week." }

Fortunately, some recent fossil discoveries have made the picture a little bit clearer." },

The name Ambulocetus natans comes from Latin of course, and means “walking whale that swims”. It clearly had four limbs that could have been used for walking. It also had a long thin tail, typical of mammals, something we don't see in today's whales. But, it also had a long skeletal structure. And that long skeletal structure suggests that it was aquatic." },

Now before the Europeans made contact with the Americas, they subsisted mainly on grains, grains that often suffered from crop failures." },

When nutrients are used over and over in the environment, we call that a nutrient cycle. Because of the importance of nutrients and their scarcity, nutrient recycling is one of the most significant eco-system processes that we’ll cover in this course." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "The three most important nutrient cycles are the nitrogen cycle, the carbon cycle and the one we are going to talk about today, the Phosphorus cycle. So the Phosphorus cycle has been studied a lot by ecologists because like I said, Phosphorus is an important nutrient and it’s not so abundant. The largest quantities are found in rocks and at the bottom of the ocean." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "How does Phosphorus get there? Well, let’s start with the Phosphorus in rocks. The rocks get broken down into smaller and smaller particles as they are weathered. They are weathered slowly by rain and wind over long periods of time. Phosphorus is slowly released as the rocks are broken down and it gets spread around into the soil. Once it’s in the soil, plants absorb it through their roots." },
        { "speaker": "Student", "text": "So that’s the reason people mine rocks that contain a lot of Phosphorus to help with agriculture?" },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "Uh-huh, they mine the rock, artificially break it down and put the Phosphorus into agricultural fertilizers. So humans can play a role in the first part of the Phosphorus cycle – the breaking down of rocks and the spreading of Phosphorus into the soil by speeding up the rate at which this natural process occurs. You see." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "Now after the Phosphorus is in the soil, plants grow. They use Phosphorus from the soil to grow. And when they die, they decompose. And the Phosphorus is recycled back into the soil; same thing with the animals that eat those plants, or eat other animals that have eaten those plants. We call all of this – the land phase of the Phosphorus cycle. But a lot of the Phosphorus in soil gets washed away into rivers by rain and melting snow. And so begins another phase of the cycle. Can anyone guess what it is called? Nancy?" },
        { "speaker": "Nancy", "text": "Well, if the one is called the land phase, then this has to be called the water phase, right?" },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "Yes, that’s such a difficult point, isn’t it? In a normal water phase, rivers eventually empty into oceans, and once in the oceans, the Phosphorus gets absorbed by water plants like algae. Then fish eats the algae or eat other fish that have eaten those plants. But the water phase is sometimes affected by excessive fertilizers." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "If not all of Phosphorus gets used by the crops and large amounts of Phosphorus gets into the rivers, this could cause rapid growth of water plants in the river, which can lead to the water ways getting clogged with organisms, which can change the flow of the water. Several current studies are looking at these effects and I really do hope we can find a way to deal with this issue before these ecosystems are adversely affected. Ok?" },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "Of course, another way that humans can interrupt the normal process is fishing. The fishing industry helps bring Phosphorus back to land. In the normal water phase the remaining Phosphorus makes its way, settles to the bottom of the ocean and gets mixed into ocean sediments." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "But remember, this is a cycle. The Phosphorus at the bottom of the ocean has to somehow make its way back to the surface, to complete the cycle, to begin the cycle all over again. After millions of years, powerful geological forces, like underwater volcanoes, lift up the ocean sediments to form new land. When an underwater volcano pushes submerged rock to the surface, a new island is created. Then over many more years the Phosphorus-rich rocks of the new land begin to erode and the cycle continues." },
        { "speaker": "Student", "text": "What about, well, you said that the nitrogen cycle is also an important nutrient cycle. And there is a lot of nitrogen in the atmosphere, so I was wondering, is there a lot of Phosphorus in the atmosphere, too?" },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "Good question, George. You’re right to guess that Phosphorus can end up in Earth’s atmosphere. It can move from the land or from the oceans to the atmosphere, and vice versa. However, there’s just not a substantial amount of it there, like there is with nitrogen. It’s a very minimal quantity." }

        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "OK. If I ask about the earliest thing you can remember, I will bet for most of you, your earliest memory would be from about age 3, right? Well, that’s true for most adults. We can’t remember anything that happened before the age of 3. And this phenomenon is so widespread and well-documented. It has a name. It’s called childhood amnesia and was first documented in 1893." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "As I said, this phenomenon refers to adults not being able to remember childhood incidents. It’s not children trying to remember events from last month or last year. Of course it follows that if you can’t remember an incident as a child, you probably won’t remember it as an adult. OK. So … why is this? What are the reasons for childhood amnesia?" },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "Well, once a popular explanation was that childhood memories are repressed... uh, the memories are disturbing so that as adults we keep them buried. And so we can’t recall them and this is based on…well it’s not based on, on, on… the kind of solid research and lab testing I want to talk about today. So let’s put that explanation aside and concentrate on just two. OK?" },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "It could be that as children we do form memories of things prior to age of 3, but forget them as we grow older. That’s one explanation. Another possibility is that children younger than 3 lack some cognitive capacity for memory. And that idea, that children are unable to form memories, that’s been the dominant belief in psychology for the past 100 years." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "And this idea is very much tied two things, the theories of Jean Piaget and also to language development in children. So Piaget’s theory of cognitive development – Piaget suggested that because they don’t have language, children younger than 18-24 months leave in the here and now. That is, they lack the means to symbolically represent objects, and events that are not physically present. Everybody get that? Piaget proposed that young children don’t have a way to represent things that aren’t right in front of them. That’s what language does, right? Words represent things, ideas." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "Once language starts to develop from about age 2, they do have a system for symbolic representation and can talk about things which are not in their immediate environment including the past. Of course he didn’t claim that infants don’t have any sort of memory, it is acknowledged that they can recognize some stimuli, like faces. And for many years this model was very much in favor in psychology, even though memory tests were never performed on young children." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "Well, finally in the 1980s, a study was done. And this study showed that very young children under the age of 2 do have the capacity for recall. Now if the children can’t talk, how was recall tested? Well, that is a good question, since the capacity for recall has always been linked with the ability to talk." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "So the researcher set up an experiment using imitation-based tasks. Adults used props, uh, toys or other objects to demonstrate an action that had 2 steps. The children were asked to imitate the steps immediately and then again after delays of one or more months, and even after a delay, the children could…could recall or replicate the action, the objects used, the steps involved and the order of the steps, even children as young as 9 months!" },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "Now, tests showed that there was a faster rate of forgetting among the youngest children, but most importantly, it showed that the development of recall did not depend on language development. And that was an importance finding. I guess I should add that the findings: Don’t say that there was no connection between the development of language and memory. There are some evidence that being able to talk about an event does lead to having a stronger memory of that event. But that does not seem the real issue here." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "So, back to our question about the cause of childhood amnesia. Well, there is something called the rate of forgetting. And childhood amnesia may reflect a high rate of forgetting; in other words, children under the age of 3 do form memories and do so without language. But they forget the memories at a fast rate, probably faster than adults do. Researchers have set a standard….sort of an expected rate of forgetting, but that expected rate was set based on tests done on the adults. So what is the rate of forgetting for children under the age of 3? We expect it to be high, but the tests to prove this really haven’t been done yet." }

        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "OK, today we are going to continue our discussion of the parenting behaviors of birds. And we are going to start by talking about what are known as distraction displays. Now if you were a bird and there was a predator around. What are you going to do? Well, for one thing you are going to try to attract as little attention as possible, right?" },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "Because if the predator doesn’t know you are there, it is not going to try to eat you. But sometimes certain species of birds do the exact opposite when a predator approaches, they do their best to attract the attention of that predator. Now why would they do that? Well, they do that to draw the predator away from their nest, away from their eggs or their young birds. And the behaviors that the birds engage in to distract predators are called distraction displays." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "And there are a number of different kinds of distraction displays. Most of the time, when birds are engaging in distraction displays, they are going to be pretending either that they have an injury or that they’re ill or that they’re exhausted, you know, something that’ll make the predator think 'Hum… here is an easy meal'. One pretty common distraction display was called the broken wing display." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "And in a broken wing display, the bird spreads and drags its wing or its tail, and while it does that, it slowly moves away from the nest. So it really looks like a bird with a broken wing. And these broken wing displays can be pretty convincing." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "Another version of this kind of distraction display is where the bird creates the impression of a mouse or some other small animal that’s running along the ground. A good example of that kind of displays is created by a bird called the purple sandpiper." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "Now what the purple sandpiper does is when a predator approaches, it drags its wings, but not to give the impression that its wings are broken, but to create the illusion that it has a second pair of legs." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "And then it raises its feathers, so it looks like it’s got a coat of fur. And then it runs along the ground, swirling left and right, you know like it’s running around a little rocks and sticks. And as it goes along, it makes a little squealing noise. So from a distance, it really looks and sounds like a little animal running along the ground, trying to get away. Again to the predator, it looks like an easy meal." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "Now what’s interesting is that birds have different levels of performance of these distraction displays. They don’t give their top performance, their prime time performance every time. What they do is they save their best performances, their most conspicuous and most risky displays, for the time just before the baby birds become able to take care of themselves." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "And they time it that way because that’s when they have made the greatest investment in parenting their young." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "So they are not going to put on their best performance just after they laid their eggs because they haven’t invested that much more time and energy in parenting yet. The top performance is going to come later." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "Now you have some birds that are quiet mature, are quite capable almost as soon as they hatch. And in that case, the parent will put on the most conspicuous distractions displays just before the babies’ hatch because once the babies are hatched they can pretty much take care of themselves, and then you have others birds that are helpless when they hatch. In that case, the parent will save its best performances until just before the babies get their feathers." }

        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "This has been an ongoing theme in our discussions, and we will be getting back to it in just a moment.

        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "That's the one. Here is a drawing of what we consider of a classic Cape Cod house. These days, you see this style all over the United States. But it first showed up in U.S. northeast, in the New England region, around the late 1600s. For those of you who don't know the northeast costal region, Cape Cod is a peninsula, a narrow strip of land that juts out into the Atlantic, and so many houses in this particular style were built on Cape Cod, that the name of the place became the name of the style." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "Now why did the Cape Cod style house become so popular in the northeast? Well, one reason is that it's a great example of form following function. We've talked about this design principle a lot about form following function. And what did we say it's meant? Someone give me an application of this principle. What is this concept that form should follow function? How would it be applied to housing design?" },
        { "speaker": "Student_2", "text": "Well, if it means that the design of a building should be based on the needs of the people who use it, then, well, the architect has to be very practical to think about the people who actually be living in the house or working in the office building, whatever. So for the architect, it's all about the users not about showing off how creative you can be." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "Good, of course. For a Cape Cod house, it might be even more accurate to say that form also follows climate. Who knows what the climate's like on Cape Cod?" },
        { "speaker": "Student_1", "text": "Cold in the winter..." },
        { "speaker": "Student_2", "text": "And whenever I visit my grandparents, it's really wet. It's usually either raining or snowing or foggy and windy, too. I guess because it's so exposed to the ocean?" },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "That's right. So take another look at this drawing, and you can image how this design might be particularly helpful in that kind of climate. Notice how the house is fairly low to the ground. This relatively low compact structure helps the house withstand the strong winds blowing off the ocean." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "And look at the slope of the roof, the steep angle helps keep off all that rain and snow that accumulates in the winter. Another thing, Cape Cod houses usually face south to take advantage of the sun's warmth through the windows. That's helpful in winter. Now what can you tell me about the chimney, about its location." },
        { "speaker": "Student_2", "text": "Well, it's in the middle. Because...does that have something to do with heating the houses? I mean since the heat never has to travel very far." },
        { "speaker": "Student_1", "text": "That means you can heat the house more efficiently, right?" },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "Exactly, now see how the house has very little exterior decoration, that's also typical of early Cape Cod houses. The wind was one reason, nothing sticking out might blow away in the harsh weather, but there was probably another reason, not related to the climate, more reflection of a rural New England society back then." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "You see Cape Cod houses were not built in the big cities, where all the rich people lived back then. These were modest dwellings." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "The people who built them simply couldn't afford lots of expensive decorative details. But that was more than just a matter of money. In these rural areas, people depended on each other for survival. Neighbors had to help and support each other in a difficult environment, so you didn't want to appear to be showing off." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "You'd want to avoid anything that might set you apart from your neighbors, the same people you might need to help you someday. So all these help to create an attitude of conformity in the community, and you can see why a modest, a very plain style would become so widely imitated throughout rural New England." },
        { "speaker": "Student_2", "text": "It is plain, but you know it's nice looking." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "Good point, and in fact it's precisely that as aesthetic appeal, the...the purity, the nearly perfect proportions of the house...that's another reason for the Cape Cod's enduring popularity even in places where the climate's so mild, that it's functional design doesn't matter." }

        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "Oh, yes. Farmers moved south. But the land was not suitable for farming. You can't grow oranges in wetlands, so farmers had to transform the wetlands into lands suitable for farming. To do that, you have to drain the water from the land, move the water elsewhere, and divert to the water sources such as rivers." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "Hundreds of miles of drainage canals were built in the wetlands. Now these areas, the new areas the farmers moved to, used to be warm and unlikely to freeze. However, recently the area has become susceptible to freezes. And we are trying to understand why." },
        { "speaker": "Student_B", "text": "Is it some global temperature change or weather pattern like El Nino, or something?" },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "Well, there are two theories. One idea is as you suggest that major weather patterns, something like El Nino, are responsible. But the other idea and this is the one that I personally subscribe to, is that the changes in the temperature pattern have been brought about by the loss of the wetlands." },
        { "speaker": "Student_A", "text": "Well, how would the loss of wetlands make a difference?" },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "Well, think about what we've been studying so far. We discussed the impact of landscapes on temperature, right? What effects does the body of water have on an area?" },
        { "speaker": "Student_A", "text": "Oh, yeah. The bodies of water tend to absorb the heat during the day, and then they release the heat at night." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "Yes, exactly. What you just said is what I want you all to understand. Bodies of water release heat and moisture back into the environment. So places near large bodies of water are generally milder, err...slightly warmer than those without water. And what I, another think is that the loss of the wetlands has created the situation where the local temperatures in the area are not slightly different, slightly colder than they were 100 years ago, before the wetland were drained." },
        { "speaker": "Student_B", "text": "Emm...do we know what the temperature was like back then?" },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "Well, we were able to estimate this. We have data about South Florida's current landscape, emm...the plant cover. And we were able to reconstruct data about its landscape prior to 1900. Then we enter those data, information about what the landscape look like before and after the wetlands were drained. We enter the data into a computer weather model. This model can predict temperatures. And when all the data were entered, an overall cooling trend was predicted by the model." },
        { "speaker": "Student_B", "text": "How much colder does it get now?" },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "Well, actually the model shows a drop of only a few degrees Celsius. But this is enough to cause dramatic damage to crops. If temperatures over night are already very close to the freezing point, then this drop of just a few degrees can take the temperature below freezing. And freezing causes frosts, which kill crops. These damaging frosts wouldn't happen if the wetlands were still in existence, just as the tiny temperature difference can have major consequences." }

        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "Let's get started. Um, last time we were talking about the need for advertising. Now, let's look at how you can successfully call attention to the service or product you want to sell. To succeed, you’ve got to develop a systematic approach. If you don't come up with a system, um, a plan, you risk making decisions that waste money, or even drive away potential customers." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "But what does a systematic advertising plan look like? Well, it covers what we call – the ‘Four Ms’. The ‘Four Ms’: Market, Media, Money, Message. All are important areas to focus on when creating your advertising plan. We will look at them one by one." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "The First step is to look at your market, that’s the people who might become customers, buyers of your service or product. You need to know all about your possible customers: Who are they? What age group are they? What do they like, or dislike? How do they shop? So, you got that? A market is a group of potential customers." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "Next, Media. Obviously, the major media are television, radio, newspapers, magazines, um, the billboards, and so forth. They are all avenues of communication. And you need to figure out: Which media you should advertise through? Which media will reach your intended audience, your market? So, you do research, trying to determine which media will reach the most potential customers for the lowest cost." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "For instance, if you have a product, that we'll say teachers would like, then teachers are your market. So you ask yourself: What magazines do the majority of teachers read? What TV programs do teachers watch? Do teachers listen to much radio? At what times of the day?" },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "Say, now your research turns up two magazines that teachers read. And it also shows that the majority of teachers, say ages twenty to thirty, read the magazine about classroom activities, while most teachers older than that read the other magazine, the one about, oh, let’s say, ‘Educational Psychology’. You think your product will appeal most to teachers ages twenty to thirty, so you decide to put your advertisement in their favorite magazine, the one about classroom activities." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "You don't waste money advertising in the ‘Educational Psychology’ magazine, you know the one that the younger teachers generally don't read. And since you’re reaching the majority of the teachers in your target age group, you’re probably spending your money well, which brings us to the third M – Money. You have an advertising budget to spend, but how do you to spend it wisely. Again, research is the key." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "Good research gives you facts, facts that can help you decide, well, as we already mentioned, decide the right market to target, and the best media to use. But also: When to advertise? Or…or how to get the best rates? Like, may be you’re advertising Sport equipment, and you have been spending most of your budget during the holiday season when people buy gifts for each other." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "Now, in theory, that would seem a great time to advertise, but may be a research shows you’re wrong, that the customers who buy sports equipment tend not to give it as a holiday gift, but want to use it themselves. In that case, advertising during a different season of the year might give you better results. And, um, may be it even lower non-holiday rates. So you actually save money. But you need to get the facts; facts that come from good research to be certain and know for sure that you’re getting your money’s worth." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "OK, finally, there is your message: What you want to say about your product? Why buying it will make the customer’s life easier, or safer or better somehow. Whatever the message is, make sure you get it right. Let me give you an example of not getting it right, Ha...ha...ha... you are going to love this one: There was this Soup Shop. The soup was really tasty, but there weren't a lot of customers. The owner thought that may be if they give something away for free with each purchase, then more people would come buy soup. So they got some cheap socks, and they advertise to give a pair away with each bowl of soup." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "But, then even fewer people came to the restaurant. Well, you can imagine why. People started to associate the soup with feet; they began to imagine the soup smelled like feet. The advertising massage, “soup means free socks”, was a bad choice; it was a waste of money. And worse, it caused the loss of customers. Now, I want everyone to get into small groups and come up with some examples, not of good advertising messages, but of truly disastrous ones. Think of real examples or make some up, and talk about the reasons those messages are unsuccessful. And then we’ll get back together and share." }

      { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "As we learn more about the DNA in human cells and how it controls the growth and development of cells, then maybe we can explain a very important observation, that when we try to grow most human cells in a laboratory, they seem programmed to divide only a certain number of times before they die." },
      { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "Now this differs with the type of cell. Some cells, like nerve cells, only divide seven to nine times in their total life. Others, like skin cells, will divide many, many more times. But finally the cells stop renewing themselves and they die. And in the cells of the human body itself, in the cells of every organ, of almost every type of tissue in the body, the same thing will happen eventually." },
      { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "OK, you know that all of persons' genetic information is contained on very long pieces of DNA called Chromosomes, 46 of them in the human cells. That's 23 pairs of these Chromosomes of various length and sizes. Now if you look at this rough drawing of one of them, one Chromosome about to divide into two. You'll see that it sort of looks like, well actually, it's much more complex than this, but it reminds us of a couple of springs linked together to coil up pieces of DNA." },
      { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "And if you stretch them out you will find they contain certain genes, certain sequences of DNA that help to determine how the cells of the body will develop. When researchers looked really carefully at the DNA in Chromosomes though, they were amazed, we all were, to find that only a fraction of it, maybe 20-30%, converts into meaningful genetic information." },
      { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "It's incredible; at least it was to me. But if you took away all the DNA that codes for genes, you still have maybe 70% of the DNA left over. That's the so-called JUNK DNA. Though the word junk is used sort of tongue in cheek.The assumption is that even if these DNA doesn't make up any of the genes, it must serve some other purpose. Anyway, if we examine these ends of these coils of DNA, we will find a sequence of DNA at each end of every human Chromosome, called a telomere." },
      { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "Now a telomere is a highly repetitious and genetically meaningless sequence of DNA, what we were calling JUNK DNA. But it does have an important purpose: it is sort of like the plastic tip on each end of shoelace. It may not help you tie your shoe but that little plastic tip keeps the rest of the shoelace, the shoe string from unraveling into weak and useless threads." },
      { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "Well, the telomere at the end of Chromosomes seems to do about the same thing – protect the genes the genetically functional parts of the Chromosome from being damaged. Every time the Chromosome divides, every time one cell divides into two, pieces of the ends of the Chromosome, the telomeres, get broken off. So after each division, the telomeres get shorter and one of the things that may happen after a while is that pieces of the genes themselves get broken off the Chromosomes." },
      { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "So the Chromosome is now losing important genetic information and is no longer functional. But as long as the telomeres are at certain length, they keep this from happening. So it seems that, when the, by looking at the length of the telomeres on specific Chromosomes, we can actually predict pretty much how long certain cells can successfully go on dividing. Now, there are some cells that just seem to keep on dividing regardless, which may not be always a good thing if it gets out of control." },
      { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "But when we analyze the cells chemically, we find something very interesting, a chemical in them, and an enzyme called telomerase. As bits of the telomere break off from the end of Chromosome, this chemical, this telomerase can rebuild it, can help reassemble the protective DNA, the telomere that the Chromosome is lost." },
      { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "Someday we may be able to take any cell and keep it alive functioning and reproducing itself essentially forever through the use of telomerase. And in the future, we may have virtually immortal nerve cells and immortal skin cells of whatever because these chemical, telomerase can keep the telomere on the ends of Chromosomes from getting any shorter." }

      { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "OK, as we've talked about a key aspect of running a successful business is knowing, um, getting a good sense of what the customer actually wants, and how they perceive your product. So with that in mind, I want to describe a very simple method of researching customer preference and it's becoming increasingly common. It's called MBWA, which stands for Managing by Wandering Around." },
      { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "Now, MBWA, that's not the most technical sounding name you have ever heard, but it describes the process pretty accurately. Here's how it works." },
      { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "Basically, um, the idea is that business owners or business managers just go out and actually talk to their customers and, uh, learn more about how well the business is serving their needs, and try to see what the customer experiences, ‘cause that's a great way to discover for yourself how your product is perceived, what its strengths and weaknesses are. You know, how you can improve it, that sort of thing." },
      { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "You know Daltons? They make soup and canned vegetables and such. Well, the head of the company had Daltons' top executives walk around supermarkets, um, asking shoppers what they thought of Daltons' soups. And he used that data to make changes to the company's products. I mean, when Daltons, of all companies, embraces something as radical as MBWA, it really shows you how popular the theory has become. Yes, Lisa?" },
      { "speaker": "Student_A", "text": "But isn't it dangerous to base decisions from information from a small sample of people? Isn't large-scale market research safer, getting data on a lot of people?" },
      { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "That's a good question. And, uh, well, I don't want to pretend that MBWA is some sort of, uh, replacement for other methods of customer research. Now market research data definitely can give you a good idea of the big picture, but MBWA is really useful, it kind of filling in the blanks, you know, getting a good on-the-ground sense of how your products are used and how people need to respond to them." },
      { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "And, yes, the numbers of opinions you get is small, so you do need to be careful. But, good business managers will tell you that the biggest fear they have and one of the most frequent problems they come across is, well, becoming out of touch with what their customers really want and need. You know, surveys and market research, stuff like that, they can only tell you so much about what the customers actually want in their day to day lives. Managing by wandering around, on the other hand, well, that gets you in there and gives you a good sense of what customers' need. So, when used in combination, then, MBWA and market research, well, they are powerful tools." },
      { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "Oh, here's another example for you. Uh, senior executives for a clothing manufacture, it was, um, Elkin, Elkin jeans, you know? They went and worked in the store for a few days, selling Elkin's clothes. Now that gave them a very different idea about their product. They saw how people responded to it. They could go up to customers in the store and asked them questions about it. Uh, yes, Mike?" },
      { "speaker": "Student_B", "text": "Well, I would think that a lot of customers would be bothered by, you know, if I'm shopping, I don't know if I want some business representative coming up to me and asking me questions. It's like when I get phone calls at home from market researchers. I just hang up on them." },
      { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "Well, it's certainly true that, well, no one likes getting calls at home from market researchers or people like that. But I'll tell you something. Most customers have the exact opposite reaction when it comes to MBWA. Now, don't ask me why because I really have no idea. But the fact is, that customers tend to respond really well to MBWA, which is the key reason for its success." },
      { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "In fact, the techniques of MBWA work so well. They've actually been extended to all kinds of different contexts like politics, for instance. Uh, a few years back, the mayor of Baltimore, uh, I think his name was Shaffer, or something like that. Anyway, he decided that the best way to serve the people of the city, of his city, was to actually get out there in it and experience the things that they experienced." },
      { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "So, he'd ride around the city and, well you know, in all parts of it, and he'd see all the pot holes. He'd see how the trash was sometimes, uh, not picked up off the side of the street. And then he'd go back to his office and he'd write these memos, now, they were memos to his staff about the problems he'd seen and how they needed to be fixed. You know, that sort of thing." },
      { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "But, the thing is, he got all these information just by going around and seeing the different Baltimore neighborhoods and talking to the people in them. Now, he called this smart politics; we'd call it MBWA, or just playing good customer service." }

      { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "The word opera means work, actually it means works. It's the plural of the word opus from the Latin. And in Italian, it refers in general to works of art. Opera Lyric or Lyric Opera refers to what we think of as opera, the musical drama. Opera was commonplace in Italy for almost a thousand years before it became commercial as a venture. And during those years, several things happened, primarily linguistic or thematic and both involving secularization." },
      { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "Musical drama started in the churches. It was an educational tool. It was used primarily as a vehicle for teaching religion and was generally presented in the Latin, the language of the Christian Church which had considerable influence in Italy at that time. But the language of everyday life was evolving in Europe and at a certain point in the middle ages, it was really only aristocrats, merchants, and clergy who can deal with Latin. The vast majority of the population used their own regional vernacular in all aspects of their lives." },
      { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "And so, in what is now Italy, operas quit being presented in Latin and started being presented in Italian. And once that happened, the themes of the opera presentations also started to change. And musical drama moved from the church to the plaza right outside the church. And the themes again, the themes changed. And opera was no longer about teaching religion as it was about satire and about expressing the ideas of society or government without committing yourself to writing and risking imprisonment or persecution, or what have you." },
      { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "Opera, as we think of it, is of course a resurrected form. It is the melodious drama of ancient Greek theater, the term ‘melodious drama' being shortened eventually to ‘melodrama' because operas frequently are melodramatic, not to say unrealistic. And the group that put the first operas together that we have today even, were, well...it was a group of men that included Galileo's father Vincenzo, and they met in Florence." },
      { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "He and a group of friends of the Count of Bardi and they formed what is called the Camerata de Bardi. And they took classical theater and reproduced it in the Renaissance's time. This...uh...this produced some of the operas that we have today." },
      { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "Now what happened in the following centuries is very simple. Opera originated in Italy but was not confined to Italy any more than the Italians were. And so as the Italians migrated across Europe, they carried theater with them and opera specifically because it was an Italian form. What happened is that the major divide in opera that endures today took place." },
      { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "The French said opera ought to reflect the rhythm and cadence of dramatic literature, bearing in mind that we are talking about the golden age in French literature. And so the music was secondary, if you will, to the dramatic cadence of language, to the way the rhythm of language was used to express feeling and used to add drama and of course as a result, instead of arias or solos, which would come to dominated Italian opera. The French relied on what the Italians called recitativo or recitative in English. The lyrics were spoken, frequently to the accompaniment of a harpsichord." },
      { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "The French said you really cannot talk about real people who lived in opera and they relied on mythology to give them their characters and their plots, mythology, the past old traditions, the novels of chivalry or the epics of chivalry out of the middle Ages. The Italian said, 'no, this is a great historical tool and what a better way to educate the public about Neo or Attalla or any number of people than to put them into a play they can see and listen to'." },
      { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "The English appropriated opera after the French. Opera came late to England because all theaters, public theaters were closed, of course, during their civil war. And it wasn't until the restoration in 1660 that public theaters again opened and opera took off. The English made a major adjustment to opera and exported what they had done to opera back to Italy. So that you have this circle of musical influences, the Italians invented opera, the French adapted it, the English adopted it, the Italians took it back." },
      { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "It came to America late and was considered too elitist for the general public. But Broadway musicals fulfilled a similar function for a great long while. John J. Chapman wrote about opera, quote 'If an extraterrestrial being or two appear before us and say: What is your society like? What is this Earth thing all about? You could do worse than take that creature to an opera.' End quote. Because opera does, after all, begin with a man and a woman and an emotion." }

      { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "All right, folks, let’s continue our discussion of alternative energy sources and move on to what’s probably the most well-known alternative energy source, uh, solar energy. The Sun basically provides Earth with a virtually unlimited source of energy everyday but the problem has always been how do we tap this source of energy? Can anyone think of why it’s so difficult to make use of solar energy?" },
      { "speaker": "Student A", "text": "Because it is hard to gather it?" },
      { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "That’s exactly it! Solar energy is everywhere but it’s also quite diffused. And the thing is the dream of solar energy is not a new one, humanities have been trying to use the Sun’s light as a reliable source of energy for centuries. And, uh, around the beginning of the twentieth century, there were actually some primitive solar water heaters on the consumer market, but they didn’t sell very well. Any of you want to guess why?" },
      { "speaker": "Student A", "text": "Well, there were other energy choices like oil and natural gas, right?" },
      { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "Yeah! And for better or for worse, we chose to go down that path as a society. When you consider economic factors, it’s easy to see why. But then in the 1970s, there was an interest in solar energy again. Why do you think that happened?" },
      { "speaker": "Student B", "text": "Because oil and natural gas were...err...became scarce?" },
      { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "Well, not exactly. The amount of oil and natural gas in the Earth was still plentiful, but there were other reasons. Uh, it’s a political thing really and I’m not gonna get into that now. So what happened in the 1970s was: oil and natural gas became very expensive very quickly. And that spurred people to start looking into alternative forms of energy, solar energy probably being the most popular." },
      { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "But then in the 80s, this trend reversed itself when price of oil and natural gas went down. All right, let’s shift our focus now to some of the technologies that have been invented to overcome the problem of gathering diffused solar energy." },
      { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "The most basic solution is simply to carefully place windows in a building so that the Sun shines into the building and then it’s absorbed and converted into heat. Can anyone think of where this is most commonly used?" },
      { "speaker": "Student A", "text": "Greenhouses." },
      { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "Yep, greenhouses where plants are kept warm and provided with sunlight because the walls of the building are made entirely of glass. But we do also have more complex systems that are used for space heating and they fall into two categories, passive and active heating systems." },
      { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "Passive systems take advantage of the location or design of a house. For example, solar energy is gathered through large glass panels facing the Sun. The heat is then stored in water-filled tanks or concrete. No mechanical devices are used in passive heating systems. They operate with little or no mechanical assistance." },
      { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "With active systems, on the other hand, you collect the solar energy at one location and then you use pumps and fans to move heat from the collectors through a plumbing system to a tank, where it can be used to heat a home or to just provide hot water." },
      { "speaker": "Student B", "text": "Excuse me, professor, but I’ve got to ask, 'how can solar energy work at night or on cloudy days?'" },
      { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "That’s, well, that is a really good question. As a matter of fact, science is still working on it, uh, trying to find ways in enhancing energy storage techniques, so that the coming of night or cloudy days really wouldn’t matter. That is the biggest drawback of solar energy, the problem of what do you do in cases where the sun’s light is weak or virtually non-present. So, the storage of solar energy, lots of solar energy is really an important aspect." },
      { "speaker": "Student A", "text": "Does that mean that solar energy can only be used on a small scale, like heating a home?" },
      { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "Well, actually, there have been some attempts to build solar energy power plants. The world’s largest solar power plant is located in Kramer Junction, California. It can generate 194 megawatts of electric power, but that’s just a drop in the bucket. Right now the utility companies are interested in increasing the capacity of their Kramer Junction plant, but only time will tell if it will ever develop into a major source of power for that region, considering the economic and political factors involved." }
