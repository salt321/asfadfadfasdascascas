          { speaker: "Librarian", text: "That's why I'm here. What can I do for you?" },
          { speaker: "Student", text: "I'm supposed to do a literature review for my psychology course, but um... having a hard time finding articles. I don't even know where to start looking." },
          { speaker: "Librarian", text: "You said this is for your psychology course, right? So your focus is on ..." },
          { speaker: "Student", text: "Dream Interpretation." },
          { speaker: "Librarian", text: "Well, you have a focus, so that's already a good start. Hmmm... well, there're a few things... oh wait... have you checked to see if your professor put any material for you to look at on reserve?" },
          { speaker: "Student", text: "Aha, that's one thing I did know to do. I just copied an article, but I still need three more on my topic from three different journals." },
          { speaker: "Librarian", text: "Let's get you going on looking for those then. We have printed versions of twenty or so psychology journals in the Reference Section. These are the ones published within the last year. Then I think about it... there's a journal named Sleep and Dream." },
          { speaker: "Student", text: "Oh, yeah, the article I just copied is from that journal, so I've got to look at other sources." },
          { speaker: "Librarian", text: "Ok, actually, most of our materials are available electronically now. You can access psychology databases or electronic journals and articles through the library's computers, and if you want to search by title with the word ‘dream' for example, just type it in and all the articles with ‘dream' in the title will come up on the screen." },
          { speaker: "Student", text: "Cool, that's great! Too bad I cannot do this from home." },
          { speaker: "Librarian", text: "But you can. All of the library's databases and electronic sources can be accessed through any computer connected to the university network." },
          { speaker: "Student", text: "Really?! I can't believe I didn't know that. It still sounds like it's going to take a while though, you know, going through all of that information, all of those sources." },
          { speaker: "Librarian", text: "Maybe, but you already narrow your search down to articles on Dream Interpretation, so it shouldn't be too bad. And you probably notice that there's an abstract or summary at the top of the first page of the article you copied. When you go into the databases and electronic sources, you have the option to display the abstracts on the computer screen, skimming those to decide whether or not you want to read the whole article should cut down some time." },
          { speaker: "Student", text: "Right, abstracts! They'll definitely make the project more doable. I guess I should try out the electronic search while I'm still here then, you know, just in case." },
          { speaker: "Librarian", text: "Sure, er...that computer's free over there, and I'll be here till five this afternoon." },

        "2": [
          { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "Ok, I'm going to begin this lecture by giving you your next assignment. Remember I said that at some point during this semester I wanted you to attend an exhibit at the Fairy Street Gallery and then write about it? Well, the exhibit that I want you to attend is coming up. It's already started in fact, but it'll be at the gallery for the next month, which should give you plenty of time to complete this assignment." },
          { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "The name of the artist exhibiting there is Rose Frantzen. Frantzen's work may be unfamiliar to you since she's a relatively young artist, but she's got a very unusual style, compared to some of the artists we've looked at this term. But anyway, Frantzen's style is what she herself calls Realistic Impressionism. So you've probably studied both of these movements separately, separate movements, Realism and Impressionism, in some of your art history courses. So who can just sum these up?" },
          { "speaker": "Student", "text": "Well, Impressionism started in the late 19th century. Um...the basic impressionist style was very different from earlier styles. It didn't depict scenes or models exactly as they looked. Um... Impressionist painters tended to apply paint really thickly, and in big brushstrokes, so the texture of the canvas was rough." },
          { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "Good. What else? What were the subjects?" },
          { "speaker": "Student", "text": "Well, a lot of impressionist artists painted everyday scenes, like people on the streets and in cafes, lots of nature scenes, especially landscapes." },
          { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "Good. So when you go to the exhibit, I really want you to take a close look at a certain painting. It's a farm scene. And you will see it right as you enter the gallery. The reason I think this painting is so important is that it stresses the impressionist aspect of Frantzen's style. It's an outdoor scene, an everyday scene. It's kind of bleak, which you can really see those broad brushstrokes and the blurry lines." },
          { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "The colors aren't quite realistic. The sky is kind of, well, an unnatural... pinkish yellow. And the fence in the foreground is blue, but somehow the overall scene gives an impression of a cold, bleak, winter day on a farm. So that's the impressionist side of her work. Oh, and speaking about farms, that reminds me one interesting thing I read about Franzten is that when she first moved back to Iowa after living abroad, she often visited this place in her town called the Sales Barn." },
          { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "And the Sales Barn, it was basically this place where the local farmers bought and sold their cattle, their farm animals. And the reason Frantzen went there, and she later on would visit other places like dance halls, was to observe people and the ways that they moved. She really found that this helped her work--that it gave her an understanding of body movements and actions, how humans move, and stand still, what their postures were like, too. So, what about Realism? What are the elements of Realism we should be looking for in Frantzen's work?" },
          { "speaker": "Student", "text": "Um... real honest depictions of subject matter, pretty unidealized stuff, and pretty everyday subject matter, too." },
          { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "Good. One other painting I really want you to look at is of a young woman surrounded by pumpkins. You will notice that the woman's face is so realistic looking that it's almost like a photograph. The woman's nose is a little less than perfect and her hair is kind of messed up. This is realism." },
          { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "But then, the background of the painting, this woman with the pumpkins is wrapped in a blanket of broad thick brushstrokes, and, it's all kinds of zigzagging brushstrokes and lines, kind of chaotic almost when you look at it close. And there are vibrant colors. There's lots of orange, with little hints of an electric blue peeking out." },
          { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "I find Frantzen to be a very accessible artist. I mean, some artists, to appreciate them, you have to know their life story. But here's a little bit about Rose Frantzen's life anyway. She attended art school, but was told by one of her instructors that she was not good at illustration, that she should go into advertising instead." },
          { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "So she took advertising classes and fine arts classes too, until she was convinced by the head of an advertising agency that her work was really good, that she could be an artist." },
          { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "But of course, it's not as easy as that, and so Frantzen had to paint other people's portraits at places like art fairs just to make money to buy paint for her more series of art work. No matter what, she never stopped painting. And now, Frantzen is doing extremely well. And her work is being shown all over the country." },
          { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "So I think most of us would be discouraged if we had to face challenges and difficulties like that. But what's important is that you keep at it that you don't give up. That's what is really important to remember." }

          { "speaker": "Narrator", "text": "Listen to part of a lecture in a geology class." },
          { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "Ok, let’s get started. Great. Today I want to talk about a way in which we are able to determine how old a piece of land, or some other geologic feature is - dating techniques. I’m going to talk about a particular dating technique. Why? Good dating is a key to good analysis. In other words, if you want to know how a land formation was formed, the first thing you probably want to know is how old it is. It’s fundamental." },
          { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "Um… Take the Grand Canyon for instance. Now, we geologists thought we had a pretty good idea of how the Grand Canyon in the southwestern United States was formed. We knew that it was formed from sandstone that solidified somewhere between 150 and 300 million years ago. Before it solidified, it was just regular sand. Essentially, it was part of a vast desert." },
          { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "And until just recently, most of us thought the sand had come from an ancient mountain range fairly close by that flattened out over time. That’s been the conventional wisdom among geologists for quite some time. But now we’ve learned something different, and quite surprising, using a technique called Uranium-Lead Dating." },
          { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "I should say that Uranium-Lead Dating has been around for quite a while. But there have been some recent refinements. I will get into this in a minute. Anyway, Uranium-Lead Dating has produced some surprises. Two geologists discovered that about half of the sand from the Grand Canyon was actually once part of the Appalachian Mountains. That’s really eye-opening news, since the Appalachian Mountain Range is, of course, thousands of kilometers to the east of the Grand Canyon. Sounds pretty unbelievable, right?" },
          { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "Of course, the obvious question is how did that sand end up so far west? The theory is that huge rivers and wind carried the sand west where it mixed in with the sand that was already there. Well, this was a pretty revolutionary finding. Um… and it was basically because of Uranium-Lead Dating. Why?" },
          { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "Well, as everyone in this class should know, we usually look at the grain type within sandstone, meaning the actual particles in the sandstone, to determine where it came from. You can do other things too, like look at the wind or water that brought the grains to their location and figure out which way it was flowing. But that’s only useful up to a point, and that’s not what these two geologists did." },
          { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "Uranium-Lead Dating allowed them to go about it in an entirely different way. What they did was: they looked at the grains of Zircon in the sandstone. Zircon is a material that contains radioactive Uranium, which makes it very useful for dating purposes." },
          { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "Zircon starts off as molten magma, the hot lava from volcanoes. This magma then crystallizes. And when Zircon crystallizes, the Uranium inside it begins to change into Lead. So if you measure the amount of Lead in the Zircon grain, you can figure out when the grain was formed. After that, you can determine the age of Zircon from different mountain ranges." },
          { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "Once you do that, you can compare the age of the Zircon in the sandstone in your sample to the age of the Zircon in the mountains. If the age of the Zircon matches the age of one of your mountain ranges, then it means the sandstone actually used to be part of that particular mountain range. Is everybody with me on that? Good. So, in this case, Uranium-Lead Dating was used to establish that half of the sandstone in the samples was formed at the same time the granite in the Appalachian Mountains was formed." },
          { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "So because of this, this new way of doing Uranium-Lead Dating, we’ve been able to determine that one of our major assumptions about the Grand Canyon was wrong. Like I said before, Uranium-Lead Dating has been with us for a while. But, um… until recently, in order to do it, you really had to study many individual grains. And it took a long time before you got results. It just wasn’t very efficient. And it wasn’t very accurate." },
          { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "But technical advances have cut down on the number of grains you have to study, so you get your results faster. So I’ll predict that Uranium-Lead Dating is going to become an increasingly popular dating method. There are a few pretty exciting possibilities for Uranium-Lead Dating." },
          { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "Here is one that comes to mind. You know the theory that earth’s continents were once joined together and only split apart relatively recently? Well, with Uranium-Lead Dating, we could prove that more conclusively. If they show evidence of once having been joined, that could really tell us a lot about the early history of the planet’s geology." }

          { "speaker": "Narrator", "text": "Listen to part of a conversation between a student and his professor." },
          { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "Hi Mathew, I'm glad you can come in today. You've been observing Mr. Grable's third-grade class for your approaches to education paper, right?" },
          { "speaker": "Student", "text": "Hmmm, yes. I go over the Johnson Elementary School, you know, to watch Mr. Grable teach the children in class. It's been amazing, I mean, I'm just learning so much from just watching him. I'm so glad the classroom observations are a requirement for the education program. I mean it's like the best thing ever to prepare you to be a good teacher." },
          { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "Well, I'm glad to see you feel that way, Mathew. You know, that's the goal. So, I've been reading over your observation notes and I'm quite interested in what's going on, in particular what's the astronomy unit he's been teaching." },
          { "speaker": "Student", "text": "The astronomy unit?" },
          { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "It seems that Mr. Grable has mastered the interdisciplinary approach to teaching — the way we've been talking about in class." },
          { "speaker": "Student", "text": "Oh! OK, yeah, so like when he was teaching them astronomy, he didn't just teach them the names of the planets, he used it as a way to teach mythology." },
          { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "Really! So, how did he do that?" },
          { "speaker": "Student", "text": "Well, some of the students could already name the planets, but they didn't know that the names had any meaning — the stories behind them." },
          { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "So, he..." },
          { "speaker": "Student", "text": "He introduced Greek and Roman mythology as a way of explaining. Like, you know, how like Jupiter's the biggest planet, right, and how Jupiter was the name of the king of the gods in Roman mythology, right? So since Jupiter, the planet, is the largest planet in our solar system, it's like the king of the planets, like Jupiter was the king of all the gods." },
          { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "Oh, Mathew, that's a great example." },
          { "speaker": "Student", "text": "Yeah! And each student chose a planet and then did research on it to write a report and make a presentation. They went to the library to do the research, then they made presentations about the planet they chose." },
          { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "So, in one science unit, in which the focus was astronomy, the students also learned about the literature of Greek and Roman mythology, used research skills in the library, wrote a report and practiced their oral presentation skills." },
          { "speaker": "Student", "text": "Exactly! He used this one topic to teach third-graders all that stuff — how to use the books in the library, to write reports, and even how to speak in public. Plus they had a great time doing it." },
          { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "You know, Mathew, this is just what we've been talking about in our class. I'm sure everyone can learn something from your experience. You know, Mathew, I'd love for you to talk about this astronomy unit in class on Wednesday." },
          { "speaker": "Student", "text": "Really?! Hmmm... ‘cause I don't really think I'll have any time to write my paper by then." },
          { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "Oh, you won't need to write anything new just yet. For Wednesday, use your class observation notes and explain the things we've discussed today." },
          { "speaker": "Student", "text": "Ok, that sounds all right." }

        { "speaker": "Narrator", "text": "Listen to part of a lecture in an archeology class." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "OK, we’ve been talking about early agriculture in the near east. So let’s concentrate on one site and see what we can learn from it. Let’s look at Catalhoyuk. Ah… I’d better write that down. Catalhoyuk, that’s about as close as we get in English. It’s Turkish, really. The sites in modern day Turkey, and who knows what the original inhabitants called it." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "Anyway, uh…Catalhoyuk wasn’t the first agricultural settlement in the near east, but it was pretty early, settled about 9000 years ago in the Neolithic period. And ... umm... the settlement...ah...town really, lasted about a thousand years and grew to a size of about eight or ten thousand people. That certainly makes it one of the largest towns in the world at that time." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "One of the things that make the settlement of this size impressive is the time period. It’s the Neolithic, remember, the late Stone Age. So the people that lived there had only stone tools, no metals. So everything they accomplished, like building this town, they did with just stone, plus wood, bricks, that sort of thing." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "But you got to remember that it wasn’t just any stone they had, they had obsidian. And umm... obsidian is a black, volcanic, well, almost like glass. It flakes very nicely into really sharp points. The sharpest tools of the entire Stone Age were made of obsidian. And urrr... the people of Catalhoyuk got theirs from further inland, from central Turkey, traded for it, probably." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "Anyway, what I wanna focus on is the way the town was built. The houses are all rectangular, one storey made of sun dried bricks. But what’s really interesting is that there are no spaces between them, no streets in other words, and so generally no doors on the houses either. People walked around on the roofs and entered the house through a hatchway on the roof, down a wooden ladder. You can still see the diagonal marks of the ladders in the plaster on the inside walls." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "Once you were in the house, there would be one main room and a couple of small rooms for storage. The main room had the hearths, for cooking and for heat. It would’ve been pretty cold during the winters. And it also looks like they made their tools near the fire. There tends to be a lot of obsidian flakes and chips in the hearth ashes, but no chimney." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "The smoke just went out the same hatchway that people used for going in and out themselves. So there would have been an open fire inside the house with only one hole in the roof to let the smoke out. You and I would have found it a bit too smoky in there. You can see on the walls, which they plastered and decorated with paintings. They ended up with a layer of black soot on them, and so did people’s lungs. The bones found in the graves show a layer of soot on the inside of the ribs. And that’s another unusual feature of Catalhoyuk, the burial sites." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "The graves have all been found under the houses, right under the floors. And it maybe this burial custom that explains why the houses were packed in so tightly without streets. I mean, you might think it was for protection or something, but there has been no evidence found yet of any violent attack that would indicate that kind of danger. It maybe they wanted to live as near as possible to their ancestors’ graves and be buried near them themselves. But it makes a good point." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "Based on excavations, we can know the layout of the houses and the location of the graves, but we’re only guessing when we tried to say why they did it that way. That’s the way it is with archeology. You are dealing with the physical remains that people left behind. We have no sure access to what they thought and how they felt about things. I mean it’s interesting to speculate. And the physical artifacts can give us clues, but there is a lot we can’t really know." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "So, for instance, their art. They painted on the plastered walls and usually they painted hunting scenes with wild animals in them. Now they did hunt and they also raised cereal crops and kept sheep, but we don’t know why so many of the paintings are of hunting scenes. Was it supposed to have religious or magical significance? That’s the kind of thing we can only guess at based on clues. And hopefully, further excavation of Catalhoyuk will yield more clues. But we’ll probably never know for sure." }

        { "speaker": "Narrator", "text": "Listen to part of a lecture in a biology class." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "For today's discussion, we'll review the case study on how some animals have behaviorally adapted to their environments. Now you had to read about two animal species, the Eastern marmot and the Olympic marmot." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "Marmots are rodents. They are large ground squirrels, about the size of an average house cat. And they live in a variety of habitats. And even though they spend the significant portion of the year hibernating, according to this case study, marmots are still considered excellent subjects for animal behavioral studies. Why is that?" },
        { "speaker": "Student", "text": "Well, when they are not hibernating, you can find them in open areas. And they are pretty active during the day, which makes them easy to observe, right?" },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "Uh-ha, so first let's discuss the Eastern marmots. They reside throughout the eastern region of North America where there is a temperate climate, where the growing season lasts for at least five months of the year, which is when they do all their mating, playing and eating." },
        { "speaker": "Student", "text": "Oh, I see. At first I wasn't sure what growing season meant, just from the reading, but now I get it. It's the amount of time it takes for them to grow, right? So it would be five months?" },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "Umm? Oh, uh... I'm sorry but no. It has nothing to do with that. It's not about the time it takes for Eastern marmots to grow. It's when the food is available. That is when it's not covered in snow and there is no frost covering the grass and, umm, vegetative parts of a plant's herbs and the flowers the marmots like to eat. So growing season refers to the availability of the food they eat, OK? So now how would you describe the Eastern marmots' social habits?" },
        { "speaker": "Student", "text": "Well, they are really territorial, and loners, and just so aggressive even with other Eastern marmots. And their mating ritual is just so impersonal." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "Uh-ha? Now when they emerge in the spring from hibernation, the mating process begins. For them, well, they come together to mate and then they go their separate ways. Then about six to eight weeks after birth, the offspring leave their mothers." },
        { "speaker": "Student", "text": "Really? Just six weeks? Is that possible for the offspring to make it on their own so young?" },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "Well, it's not as if they aren't ready for the real world because they are. Remember, they mature quickly and the weather's nice. Also they live in open fields where there is lots of edible vegetation. So roughly six weeks after birth, Eastern marmots are just old enough to take their chances of surviving in the temperate environment. So how does this relate to their behavior?" },
        { "speaker": "Student", "text": "Oh, I get it. Since the climate's not too bad, the Eastern marmots don't have to rely on each other too much and they really don't need to stay together as a family to survive either." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "Uh-ha. Any contrast, the Olympic marmots? What about them?" },
        { "speaker": "Student", "text": "Well, they live together as a family and take care of their young until they are at least two years old. They're really friendly with each other. And what I really like is that they even have greeting ceremonies. And they are not at all aggressive and territorial like the Eastern marmots. So their social behavior is so different from Eastern marmots because of the climate where they live? That seems so bizarre." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "Well, the Olympic marmots inhabit meadows high in the Olympic Mountains where the weather conditions are much harsher. So there is a lot more wind and snow. The growing season only lasts about two to three months. So in that much shorter period of time, all the Olympic marmots, male and female, eat, play, work and nurture the young together." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "Because the climate is so harsh, cooperation increases the survival rate of the Olympic marmots. They keep their young at home until they are physically able to survive on their own. This could explain why the social behavior of the Olympic marmots is so unlike that of the Eastern marmots." }

So, think about what you'd need to include if you were going to explain your research project to someone with general or casual knowledge about the subject, like... like your parents.

So, just set up, you know, what was the purpose of what you were doing—to try to understand the climate variability of this area—and what you did, and what your approach was." },
        { "speaker": "Student", "text": "OK. So, for example, I studied meteorological records. I looked at climate charts. I used different methods for analyzing the data, like certain statistical tests, and then I discuss the results. Is that what you mean?" },

        { "speaker": "Narrator", "text": "Listen to part of a psychology lecture. The professor is discussing behaviorism." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "Now, many people consider John Watson to be the founder of behaviorism. And like other behaviorists, he believed that psychologists should study only the behaviors they can observe and measure. They’re not interested in mental processes. While a person could describe his thoughts, no one else can see or hear them to verify the accuracy of his report." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "But one thing you can observe is muscular habits. What Watson did was to observe muscular habits because he viewed them as a manifestation of thinking. One kind of habit that he studied are laryngeal habits. Watson thought laryngeal habits . . . you know, from larynx, in other words, related to the voice box . . ." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "He thought those habits were an expression of thinking. He argued that for very young children, thinking is really talking out loud to oneself because they talk out loud even if they’re not trying to communicate with someone in particular. As the individual matures, that overt talking to oneself becomes covert talking to oneself, but thinking still shows up as a laryngeal habit." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "One of the bits of evidence that supports this is that when people are trying to solve a problem, they, um, typically have increased muscular activity in the throat region. That is, if you put electrodes on the throat and measure muscle potential—muscle activity—you discover that when people are thinking, like if they’re diligently trying to solve a problem, that there is muscular activity in the throat region." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "So, Watson made the argument that problem solving, or thinking, can be defined as a set of behaviors—a set of responses—and in this case the response he observed was the throat activity. That’s what he means when he calls it a laryngeal habit. Now, as I am thinking about what I am going to be saying, my muscles in my throat are responding. So, thinking can be measured as muscle activity. Now, the motor theory . . . yes?" },
        { "speaker": "Student", "text": "Professor Blake, um, did he happen to look at people who sign? I mean deaf people?" },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "Uh, he did indeed, um, and to jump ahead, what one finds in deaf individuals who use sign language when they’re given problems of various kinds, they have muscular changes in their hands when they are trying to solve a problem . . .muscle changes in the hand, just like the muscular changes going on in the throat region for speaking individuals. So, for Watson, thinking is identical with the activity of muscles." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "A related concept of thinking was developed by William James. It’s called ideomotor action. Ideomotor action is an activity that occurs without our noticing it, without our being aware of it. I’ll give you one simple example. If you think of locations, there tends to be eye movement that occurs with your thinking about that location. In particular, from where we’re sitting, imagine that you’re asked to think of our university library." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "Well, if you close your eyes and think of the library, and if you’re sitting directly facing me, then according to this notion, your eyeballs will move slightly to the left, to your left, ‘cause the library’s in that general direction. James and others said that this is an idea leading to a motor action, and that’s why it’s called “ideomotor action”—an idea leads to motor activity." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "If you wish to impress your friends and relatives, you can change this simple process into a magic trick. Ask people to do something such as I’ve just described: think of something on their left; think of something on their right. You get them to think about two things on either side with their eyes closed, and you watch their eyes very carefully. And if you do that, you’ll discover that you can see rather clearly the eye movement—that is, you can see the movement of the eyeballs." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "Now, then you say, think of either one and I’ll tell which you’re thinking of. OK. Well, Watson makes the assumption that muscular activity is equivalent to thinking. But given everything we’ve been talking about here, one has to ask: are there alternatives to this motor theory—this claim that muscular activities are equivalent to thinking? Is there anything else that might account for this change in muscular activity, other than saying that it is thinking? And the answer is clearly yes. Is there any way to answer the question definitively? I think the answer is no." }

It typically runs between 50 and 60 percent on the day the research paper is due. Um, I was hoping to have your exams back today, but, uh, the situation was that I went away for the weekend, and I was supposed to get in yesterday at five, and I expected to fully complete all the exams by midnight or so, which is the time that I usually go to bed, but my flight was delayed, and I ended up not getting in until one o'clock in the morning. Anyway, I'll do my best to have them finished by the next time we meet." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "OK. In the last class, we started talking about useful plant fibers. In particular, we talked about cotton fibers, which we said were very useful, not only in the textile industry, but also in the chemical industry, and in the production of many products, such as plastics, paper, explosives, and so on. Today we'll continue talking about useful fibers, and we'll begin with a fiber that's commonly known as 'Manila hemp.'" },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "Now, for some strange reason, many people believe that Manila hemp is a hemp plant. But Manila hemp is not really hemp. It's actually a member of the banana family—it even bears little banana-shaped fruits. The 'Manila' part of the name makes sense, because Manila hemp is produced chiefly in the Philippine Islands and, of course, the capital city of the Philippines is Manila." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "Now, as fibers go, Manila hemp fibers are very long. They can easily be several feet in length and they're also very strong, very flexible. They have one more characteristic that's very important, and that is that they are exceptionally resistant to salt water. And this combination of characteristics—long, strong, flexible, resistant to salt water—makes Manila hemp a great material for ropes, especially for ropes that are gonna be used on ocean-going ships." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "In fact, by the early 1940's, even though steel cables were available, most ships in the United States Navy were not moored with steel cables; they were moored with Manila hemp ropes. Now, why was that? Well, the main reason was that steel cables degrade very, very quickly in contact with salt water. If you've ever been to San Francisco, you know that the Golden Gate Bridge is red. And it's red because of the zinc paint that goes on those stainless steel cables." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "That, if they start at one end of the bridge and they work to the other end, by the time they finish, it's already time to go back and start painting the beginning of the bridge again, because the bridge was built with steel cables, and steel cables can't take the salt air unless they're treated repeatedly with a zinc-based paint." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "On the other hand, plant products like Manila hemp, you can drag through the ocean for weeks on end. If you wanna tie your anchor to it and drop it right into the ocean, that's no problem, because plant fibers can stand up for months, even years, in direct contact with salt water." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "OK. So how do you take plant fibers that individually you could break with your hands and turn them into a rope that's strong enough to moor a ship that weighs thousands of tons? Well, what you do is you extract these long fibers from the Manila hemp plant, and then you take several of these fibers, and you group them into a bundle, because by grouping the fibers you greatly increase their breaking strength—that bundle of fibers is much stronger than any of the individual fibers that compose it." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "And then you take that bundle of fibers and you twist it a little bit, because by twisting it, you increase its breaking strength even more. And then you take several of these little bundles, and you group and twist them into bigger bundles, which you then group and twist into even bigger bundles, and so on, until eventually, you end up with a very, very strong rope." }

        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "Now, why is he interested in human happiness? It’s not just because it’s something that all people want or aim for. It’s more than that. But to get there we need to first make a very important distinction." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "Let me introduce a couple of technical terms: extrinsic value and intrinsic value. To understand Aristotle’s interest in happiness, you need to understand this distinction." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "Some things we aim for and value, not for themselves but for what they bring about in addition to themselves. If I value something as a means to something else, then it has what we will call 'extrinsic value.' Other things we desire and hold to be valuable for themselves alone. If we value something not as a means to something else, but for its own sake, let us say that it has 'intrinsic value.'" },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "Exercise. There may be some people who value exercise for itself, but I don’t. I value exercise because if I exercise, I tend to stay healthier than I would if I didn’t. So I desire to engage in exercise and I value exercise extrinsically, not for its own sake, but as a means to something beyond it. It brings me good health." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "Health. Why do I value good health? Well, here it gets a little more complicated for me. Um, health is important for me because I can’t…do other things I want to do—play music, teach philosophy—if I’m ill. So health is important to me—has value to me—as a means to a productive life. But health is also important to me because I just kind of like to be healthy—it feels good. It’s pleasant to be healthy, unpleasant not to be. So to some degree, I value health both for itself and as a means to something else: productivity. It’s got extrinsic and intrinsic value for me." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "Then there’s some things that are just valued for themselves. I’m a musician, not a professional musician; I just play a musical instrument for fun. Why do I value playing music? Well, like most amateur musicians, I only play because, well, I just enjoy it. It’s something that’s an end in itself." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "Now, something else I value is teaching. Why? Well, it brings in a modest income, but I could make more money doing other things. I’d do it even if they didn’t pay me. I just enjoy teaching. In that sense it’s an end to itself. But teaching’s not something that has intrinsic value for all people—and that’s true generally." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "Most things that are enjoyed in and of themselves vary from person to person. Some people value teaching intrinsically, but others don’t. So how does all this relate to human happiness?" },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "Well, Aristotle asks: is there something that all human beings value . . . and value only intrinsically, for its own sake and only for its own sake? If you could find such a thing, that would be the universal final good, or truly the ultimate purpose or goal for all human beings." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "Aristotle thought the answer was yes. What is it? Happiness. Everyone will agree, he argues, that happiness is the ultimate end to be valued for itself and really only for itself. For what other purpose is there in being happy? What does it yield? The attainment of happiness becomes the ultimate or highest good for Aristotle." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "The next question that Aristotle raises is: what is happiness? We all want it; we all desire it; we all seek it. It’s the goal we have in life. But what is it? How do we find it? Here he notes, with some frustration, people disagree. But he does give us a couple of criteria, or features, to keep in mind as we look for what true human happiness is." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "True human happiness should be, as he puts it, complete. Complete in that it’s all we require. Well, true human happiness…if you had that, what else do you need? Nothing." },

        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "Many people value fame and seek fame. Fame for them becomes the goal. But, according to Aristotle, this won’t work either, because fame depends altogether too much on other people. I can’t get it on my own, without help from other people." },

So people went to work on finding objects that would be at that missing distance from the Sun, and then in 1801, the object Ceres was discovered." },

Um, and so, Ceres was the first and is the largest of what became many objects discovered at that same distance. Not just one thing, but all the objects found at that distance from the asteroid belt.

        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "Now, we've been talking about the loss of animal habitat from housing developments, uh ..., growing cities – small habitat losses. But today I wanna begin talking about what happens when habitat is reduced across a large area. There are, of course, animal species that require large areas of habitat, and some migrate over very long distances. So what's the impact of habitat loss on those animals – animals that need large areas of habitat?" },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "Well, I'll use the humming birds as an example. Now you know a humming bird is amazingly small, but even though it's really tiny, it migrates over very long distances, travels up and down the western hemisphere – the Americas, back and forth between where it breeds in the summer and the warmer climates where it spends the winter. So you would say that this whole area over which it migrates is its habitat because on this long distance journey, it needs to come down to feed and sleep every so often, right?" },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "Well, the humming bird beats its wings – get this – about 3 thousand times per minute. So you think, wow, it must need a lot of energy, a lot of food, right? Well, it does. It drinks a lot of nectar from flowers and feeds on some insects, but it's energy efficient too. You can't say it isn't. I mean, as it flies all the way across the Gulf of Mexico, it uses up none of its body fat." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "But that doesn't mean it doesn't need to eat. So humming birds have to rely on plants in their natural habitat. And it goes without saying, but the opposite is true as well, plants depend on humming birds too. There are some flowers that can only be pollinated by the humming birds. Without it stopping to feed and spread pollen from flower to flower, these plants would cease to exist." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "But the problem, well, as natural habitat along these migration routes is developed by humans for housing or agriculture or cleared for raising cattle, for instance, there is less food available for migrating humming birds. Their nesting sites are affected too, the same by the same sorts of human activities. And all of these activities pose a real threat to the humming bird population. So to help them survive, we need to preserve their habitats." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "And one of the concrete ways people have been doing this is by cleaning up polluted habitat areas and then replanting flowers, um, replanting native flowers that humming birds feed on. Promoting ecological tourism is another way to help save their habitat. As the number of visitors, eco-tourists who come to humming bird habitats to watch the birds, the more the number of visitors grows, the more local businesses' profit, so ecological tourism can bring financial rewards, all the more reason to value these beautiful little creatures in their habitat, right?" },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "But to understand more about how to protect and support the humming birds the best we can, we've got to learn more about their breeding, nesting sites and migration routes, and also about the natural habitats we find there. That should help us determine how to prevent further decline in the population. A good research method, a good way to learn more, is by running a banding study." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "Banding the birds allows us to track them over their lifetime. It's been a practice that's been used by researchers for years. In fact, most of what we known about humming birds comes from banding studies, where we capture a humming bird and make sure all the information about it, like its weight and age and length, are all recorded and put into an international information database." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "And then we place an extremely lightweight band on one of its legs, well, what looks like a leg, although technically it's considered part of the bird's foot. Anyway, these bands are perfectly safe, and some humming birds have worn them for years with no evidence of any problems. The band is labeled with a tracking number, oh, and there is a phone number on the band for people to call for free, to report a banded bird they've found or recaptured." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "So when a banded bird is recaptured and reported, we learn about its migration route, its growth, and how long it has been alive, its lifespan. One recaptured bird had been almost 12 years earlier – she was one of the oldest humming birds on record. Another interesting thing we've learned is that some humming birds, um, they no longer use a certain route. They travel by a different route to reach their destination. And findings like these have been of interest to biologists and environmental scientists in a number of countries who are trying to understand the complexities of how changes in a habitat affect the species in it." }

        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "Okay, we’ve been discussing films in the 1920s and 30s, and how back then film categories, as we know them today, had not yet been established. We said that by today’s standards, many of the films of the 20s and 30s would be considered hybrids, that is, a mixture of styles that wouldn’t exactly fit into any of today’s categories, and in that context." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "Today we are going to talk about a film-maker who began making very unique films in the late 1920s. He was French, and his name was Jean Painlevé. Jean Painlevé was born in 1902. He made his first film in 1928. Now in a way, Painlevé’s films conform to norms of the 20s and 30s, that is, they don’t fit very neatly into the categories we use to classify films today. That said, even by the standards of the 20s and 30s, Painlevé’s films were unique, a hybrid of styles." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "He had a special way of fusing, or some people might say confusing, science and fiction. His films begin with facts, but then they become more and more fictional. They gradually add more and more fictional elements. In fact, Painlevé was known for saying that science is fiction." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "Painlevé was a pioneer in underwater film-making, and a lot of his short films focused on the aquatic animal world. He liked to show small underwater creatures, displaying what seemed like familiar human characteristics – what we think of as unique to humans. He might take a clip of a mollusk going up and down in the water and set it to music." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "You know, to make it look like the mollusk were dancing to the music like a human being – that sort of thing. But then he suddenly changed the image or narration to remind us how different the animals are, how unlike humans. He confused his audience in the way he portrayed the animals he filmed, mixing up on notions of the categories of humans and animals." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "The films make us a little uncomfortable at times because we are uncertain about what we are seeing. It gives him films an uncanny feature: the familiar made unfamiliar, the normal made suspicious. He liked twists, he liked the unusual. In fact, one of his favorite sea animals was the seahorse because with seahorses, it’s the male that carries the eggs, and he thought that was great. His first and most celebrated underwater film is about the seahorse." },

        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "Well, actually, it was pretty rare at that time. I mean, we are talking about the early 1930s." },
        { "speaker": "Student 1", "text": "But what about Jacques Cousteau? Was he like an innovator, you know, with underwater photography too?" },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "Ah, Jacques Cousteau. Well, Painlevé and Cousteau did both film underwater, and they were both innovators, so you are right in that sense. But that’s pretty much where the similarities end. First of all, Painlevé was about 20 years ahead of Cousteau." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "And Cousteau’s adventures were high-tech, with lots of fancy equipment, whereas Painlevé kind of patched the equipment together as he needed it. Cousteau usually filmed large animals, usually in the open sea, whereas Painlevé generally filmed smaller animals, and he liked to film in shallow water." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "Uh, what else, oh well, the main difference was that Cousteau simply investigated and presented the facts – he didn’t mix in fiction. He was a strict documentarist. He set the standard really for the nature documentary. Painlevé, on the other hand, as we said before, mixed in elements of fiction. And his films are much more artistic, incorporating music as an important element." },
        { "speaker": "Student 2", "text": "Well, maybe I shouldn’t be asking this, but if Painlevé’s films are so special, so good, why haven’t we ever heard of them? I mean, everyone’s heard of Jacques Cousteau." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "Well, that’s a fair question. Uh, the short answer is that Painlevé’s style just never caught on with the general public. I mean, it probably goes back at least in part to where we mentioned earlier, that people didn’t know what to make of his films – they were confused by them, whereas Cousteau’s documentaries were very straightforward, met people’s expectations more than Painlevé’s films did. But you are true: film history buffs know about them. And Painlevé is still highly respected in many circles." }

        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "Some of the world’s oldest preserved art is the cave art of Europe, most of it in Spain and France. And the earliest cave paintings found to date are those of the Chauvet Cave in France discovered in 1994. And you know, I remember when I heard about the results of the dating of the Chauvet paintings, I said to my wife, “Can you believe these paintings are over 30,000 years old?” And my 3-yearold daughter piped up and said, “Is that older than my great-grandmother?” That was the oldest age she knew." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "And you know, come to think of it. It’s pretty hard for me to really understand how long 30,000 years is too. I mean, we tend to think that people who lived at that time must have been pretty primitive. But I’m gonna show you some slides in a few minutes and I think you will agree with me that this art is anything but primitive. They are masterpieces. And they look so real, so alive that it’s very hard to imagine that they are so very old." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "Now, not everyone agrees on exactly how old. A number of the Chauvet paintings have been dated by a lab to 30,000 or more years ago. That would make them not just older than any other cave art, but about twice as old as the art in the caves at Altamira or Lascaux, which you may have heard of." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "Some people find it hard to believe Chauvet is so much older than Altamira and Lascaux, and they noted that only one lab did the dating for Chauvet, without independent confirmation from any other lab. But be that as it may, whatever the exact date, whether it’s 15,000, 20,000 or 30,000 years ago, the Chauvet paintings are from the dawn of art. So they are a good place to start our discussion of cave painting." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "Now, one thing you’ve got to remember is the context of these paintings. Paleolithic humans - that’s the period we are talking about here, the Paleolithic, the early Stone Age, not too long after humans first arrived in Europe——the climate was significantly colder then and so rock shelters, shallow caves were valued as homes protected from the wind and rain." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "And in some cases at least, artists drew on the walls of their homes. But many of the truly great cave art sites like Chauvet were never inhabited. These paintings were made deep inside a dark cave, where no natural light can penetrate. There’s no evidence of people ever living here. Cave bears, yes, but not humans. You would have had to make a special trip into the cave to make the paintings, and a special trip to go see it. And each time you’d have to bring along torches to light your way. And people did go see the art." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "There are charcoal marks from their torches on the cave walls clearly dating from thousands of years after the paintings were made. So we can tell people went there. They came but they didn’t stay. Deep inside a cave like that is not really a place you’d want to stay, so, why? What inspired the Paleolithic artists to make such beautiful art in such inaccessible places? We’ll never really know of course, though it’s interesting to speculate." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "But, um, getting to the paintings themselves, virtually all Paleolithic cave art represents animals, and Chauvet is no exception. The artists were highly skilled at using, or even enhancing, the natural shape of the cave walls to give depth and perspectives to their drawings, the sense of motion and vitality in these animals. Well, wait till I show you the slides." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "Anyway, most Paleolithic cave art depicts large herbivores. Horses are most common overall with deer and bison pretty common too, probably animals they hunted. But earlier at Chauvet, there is a significant interest in large dangerous animals, lots of rhinoceros, lions, mammoth, bears. Remember that the ranges of many animal species were different back then so all these animals actually lived in the region at that time." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "But the Chauvet artists didn’t paint people. There is a half-man-half-bison creature and there is outline of human hands but no depiction of a full human. So, why these precise animals? Why not birds, fish, snakes? Was it for their religion, magic or sheer beauty? We don’t know. But whatever it was, it was worth it to them to spend hours deep inside a cave with just a torch between them and utter darkness. So, on that note, let’s dim the lights, so we can see these slides and actually look at the techniques they used." }

Spectroscopy is basically the study of spectra and spectral lines of light, and specifically for us, the light from stars. It makes it possible to analyze the light emitted from stars. When you analyze this light, you can figure out their distance from the earth, and identify what they are made of, determine their chemical composition." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "Before we get into that though, it's probably a good thing to back up a bit. You all know how when you take a crystal prism and pass a beam of sunlight through it, you get a spectrum, which looks like a continuous band of rainbow colors. The light that we see with our human eyes as a band of rainbow color falls in a range of what's called visible light. And visible light spectroscopy is probably the most important kind of spectroscopy. Anyone want to take a stab at the scientific term for visible light? And I'm sure all of you know this because you all did the reading for today." },

        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "Yes, and no. If you are talking about radiation, like in the element Uranium, yeah, that's dangerous. But radiation as a general term actually refers to anything that spreads away from its source. So optical radiation is just visible light energy spreading out." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "OK, so we've got a spectrum of a beam of sunlight and it looks like the colors bleed into each other. There are no interruptions, just a band flowing from violet to green, to yellow, to... you get the idea. Well, what happens if the sunlight's spectrum is magnified? Maybe you all didn't do the reading. Well, here's what you'd see. I want you to know this that this spectrum is interrupted by dark lines called spectral lines." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "If you really magnify the spectrum of the sunlight, you could identify more than 100,000 of them. They may look like kind of randomly placed, but they actually form many distinct patterns. And if you were looking at the spectrum of some other star, the colors would be the same. But the spectral lines would break it up at different places, making different patterns. Each pattern stands for a distinct chemical element, and so different sets or patterns of spectral lines mean that the star has a different chemical composition." },
        { "speaker": "Student", "text": "So how do we know which spectral patterns match up with which elements?" },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "Well, a kind of spectroscopic library of elements was compiled using flame tests. A known element, say a piece of iron for example, is heated in a pure gas flame. The iron eventually heats to the point that it radiates light. This light is passed through a prism, which breaks it up into a spectrum. And a unique pattern, kind of like a chemical fingerprint of spectral lines for that element appears." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "This process was repeated over and over again for many different elements, so we can figure out the chemical makeup of another star by comparing the spectral pattern it has to the pattern of the elements in the library. Oh, an interesting story about how one of the elements was discovered through spectroscopy. There was a pretty extensive library of spectral line patterns of elements even by the 1860s." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "A British astronomer was analyzing a spectrograph of sunlight, and he noticed a particular pattern of spectral lines that didn't match anything in the library. So he put two and two together, and decided there was an element in the sun that hadn't been discovered here on the earth yet. Any guesses about what that element is? It actually turned out to be pretty common and I'm sure all of you know it. OK. Let's try something else. Any of you happened to be familiar with the Greek word for “sun” by chance?" },

It’s appropriate under the circumstances. But what doesn’t make sense is the object the behavior’s directed towards. Ok, who else? Carol?" },
        { "speaker": "Carol", "text": "I think I read in another class about an experiment where an object that the animal was afraid of was put next to its food – next to the animal’s food. And the animal, it was conflicted between confronting the object and eating the food, so instead, it just fell asleep. Like that?" },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "That’s exactly what I mean. Displacement occurs because the animal’s got two conflicting drives – two competing urges, in this case, fear and hunger. And what happens is, they inhibit each other, they cancel each other out in a way, and a third seemingly irrelevant behavior surfaces through a process that we call ‘Disinhibition’. Now in disinhibition, the basic idea is that two drives that seem to inhibit, to hold back, a third drive." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "Or, well, they’re getting in a way of each other in a… in a conflict situation and somehow lose control, lose their inhibiting effect on that third behavior, which means that the third drive surfaces, it’s expressed in the animal’s behavior." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "Now, these displacement activities can include feeding, drinking, grooming, even sleeping. These are what we call ‘Comfort Behavior’. So why do you think displacement activities are so often comfort behaviors, such as grooming?" },
        { "speaker": "Karl", "text": "Maybe because it’s easy for them to do? I mean, grooming is like one of the most accessible things an animal can do. It’s something they do all the time, and they have the stimulus right there on the outside of their bodies in order to do the grooming, or if food is right in front of them. Basically, they don’t have to think very much about those behaviors." },
        { "speaker": "Carol", "text": "Professor, isn’t it possible that animals groom because they’ve got messed up a little from fighting or mating? I mean if a bird’s feathers get ruffled or an animal’s fur, maybe it’s not so strange for them to stop and tidy themselves up at that point." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "That’s another possible reason although it doesn’t necessarily explain other behaviors such as eating, drinking or sleeping. What’s interesting is that studies have been done that suggest that the animal’s environment may play a part in determining what kind of behavior it displays." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "For example, there’s a bird, the ‘wood thrush’, anyway, when the ‘wood thrush’ is in an attack-escape conflict, that is, it’s caught between the two urges to escape from or to attack an enemy, if it’s sitting on a horizontal branch, it’ll wipe its beak on its perch. If it’s sitting on a vertical branch, it’ll groom its breast feathers. The immediate environment of the bird, its immediate, um, its relationship to its immediate environment seems to play a part in which behavior will display." }

        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "All right, so let me close today's class with some thoughts to keep in mind while you are doing tonight's assignment. You will be reading one of Ralph Waldo Emerson's best-known essays ‘Self-Reliance' and comparing it with his poems and other works. I think this essay has the potential to be quite meaningful for all of you as young people who probably wonder about things like truth and where your lives are going - all sorts of profound questions." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "Knowing something about Emerson's philosophies will help you when you read ‘Self-Reliance'. And basically, one of the main beliefs that he had was about truth. Not that it's something that we can be taught, Emerson says it's found within ourselves. So this truth, the idea that it's in each one of us, is one of the first points that you'll see Emerson making in this essay." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "It's a bit abstract but he's very into...uh... into each person believing his or her own thought, believing in yourself, the thought or conviction that's true for you." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "But actually, he ties that in with a sort of ‘universal truth' – something that everyone knows but doesn't realize they know. Most of us aren't in touch with ourselves in a way, so we just aren't capable of recognizing profound truth. It takes geniuses, people like, say, Shakespeare, who're unique because when they have a glimpse of this truth, this universal truth, they pay attention to it and express it and don't just dismiss it like most people do." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "So Emerson is really into each individual believing in and trusting him or herself." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "You'll see that he writes about, well, first, conformity. He criticizes that people of his time for abandoning their own minds and their own wills for the sake of conformity and consistency. They try to fit in with the rest of the world even though it's at odds with their beliefs and their identities. Therefore, it's best to be a non-conformist – to do your own thing, not worrying about what other people think. That's an important point. He really drives this argument home throughout the essay." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "When you are reading, I want you to think about that and why that kind of thought would be relevant to the readers of his time. Remember this is 1838, ‘Self-Reliance' was a novel idea at the time and the United State's citizens were less secure about themselves as individuals and as Americans." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "The country as a whole was trying to define itself. Emerson wanted to give people something to really think about, help them find their own way and what it meant to be who they were. So that's something that I think is definitely as relevant today as it was then, probably, um, especially among young adults like yourselves, you know, uh, college being a time to sort of really think about who you are and where you're going." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "Now we already said that Emerson really emphasizes non-conformity, right? As a way to sort of not lose your own self and identity in the world, to have your own truth and not be afraid to listen to it. Well, he takes this a step further. Not conforming also means, uh, not conforming with yourself or your past." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "What does that mean? Well, if you've always been a certain way or done a certain thing, but it's not working for you any more, or you're not content, Emerson says that it'd be foolish to be consistent even with our own past. 'Focus on the future,' he says, 'That's what matters more. Inconsistency is good.'" },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "He talks about a ship's voyage and this is one of the most famous bits of the essay - how the best voyage is made up of zigzag lines. Up close, it seems a little all over the place, but from farther away, the true path shows and in the end it justifies all the turns along the way. So, don't worry if you are not sure where you're headed or what your long-term goals are." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "Stay true to yourself and it'll make sense in the end. I mean, I can attest to that. Before I was a literature professor, I was an accountant. Before that, I was a newspaper reporter. My life is taking some pretty interesting turns and here I am, very happy with my experiences and where they've brought me. If you rely on yourself and trust your own talents, your own interest, don't worry, your path will make sense in the end." }

We’ve been covering rocks and different types of rocks for the last several weeks. But next week we are going to do something a bit different. And to get started I thought I’d mention something that shows how uh…as a geologist, you need to know about more than just rocks and the structure of solid matter. Moving rocks, you may have heard about them. It’s quite a mystery." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "Death valley is this desert plain, a dry lake bed in California surrounded by mountains and on the desert floor these huge rocks, some of them hundreds of pounds. And they move. They leave long trails behind them, tracks you might say as they move from one point to another. But nobody has been able to figure out how they are moving because no one has ever seen it happen." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "Now there are a lot of theories, but all we know for sure is that people aren’t moving the rocks. There are no footprints, no tyre tracks and no heavy machinery like a bulldozer…uh, nothing was ever brought in to move these heavy rocks. So what’s going on?" },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "Theory NO.1 ---Wind. Some researchers think powerful uh…windstorms might move the rocks. Most of the rocks move in the same direction as the dominant wind pattern from southwest to northeast. But some, and this is interesting, move straight west while some zigzag or even move in large circles. Hmmm…How can that be?" },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "How about wind combined with rain? The ground of this desert is made of clay. It’s a desert, so it’s dry. But when there is the occasional rain, the clay ground becomes extremely slippery. It’s hard for anyone to stand on, walk on." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "Some scientists theorized that perhaps when the ground is slippery the high winds can then move the rocks. There’s a problem with this theory. One team of scientists flooded an area of the desert with water, then try to establish how much wind force would be necessary to move the rocks. And get this: you need winds of at least five hundred miles an hour to move just the smallest rocks! And winds that strong have never been recorded. Ever! Not on this planet. So I think it’s safe to say that that issue’s been settled." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "Here is another possibility – ice. It’s possible that rain on the desert floor could turn to thin sheets of ice when temperatures drop at night. So if rocks…uh become embedded in ice, uh … OK, could a piece of ice with rocks in it be pushed around by the wind? But there’s a problem with this theory, too. Rocks trapped in ice together would have moved together when the ice moved. But that doesn’t always happen. The rocks seem to take separate routes." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "There are a few other theories. Maybe the ground vibrates, or maybe the ground itself is shifting, tilting. Maybe the rocks are moved by a magnetic force. But sadly all these ideas have been eliminated as possibilities. There’s just no evidence." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "I bet you are saying to yourself, “well, why don’t scientists just set up video cameras to record what actually happens?” Thing is, this is a protected wilderness area. So by law that type of research isn’t allowed. Besides, in powerful windstorms, sensitive camera equipment would be destroyed." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "So why can’t researchers just live there for a while until they observe the rocks’ moving? Same reason. So where are we now? Well, right now we still don’t have any answers." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "So all this leads back to my main point – you need to know about more than just rocks as geologists. The researchers study in moving rocks. Well, they combine their knowledge of rocks with knowledge of wind, ice and such…uh not successfully, not yet." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "But you know, they wouldn’t even have been able to get started without um… earth science understanding – knowledge about wind, storms, you know, meteorology. You need to understand physics. So for several weeks like I said we’ll be addressing geology from a wider perspective. I guess that’s all for today. See you next time." }

        { "speaker": "Frank", "text": "Well, I guess there wasn’t really any, you know, official government support for the arts until the twentieth century. But the first attempt the United States government made to, you know, to support the arts was the Federal Art Project." },

But then when the United States became involved in the Second World War, unemployment was down and it seems that these programs weren’t really necessary any longer.

        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "It was felt by a number of politicians that …well that the government had a responsibility to support the arts as sort of… oh, what can we say?...the the soul…or spirit of the country. The idea was that there be a federal subsidy…um…uh…financial assistance to artists and artistic or cultural institutions. And for just those reasons, in 1965, the National Endowment for the Arts was created. So it was through the NEA, the National Endowment for the Arts, um…that the arts would develop, would be promoted throughout the nation." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "And then individual states throughout the country started to establish their own state arts councils to help support the arts. There was kind of uh…cultural explosion. And by the mid-1970s, by 1974 I think, all fifty states had their own arts agencies, their own state arts councils that work with the federal government with corporations, artists, performers, you name it." },
        { "speaker": "Frank", "text": "Did you just say corporations? How are they involved?" },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "Well, you see, corporations aren’t always altruistic. They might not support the arts unless…well, unless the government made it attractive for them to do so, by offering corporations tax incentives to support the arts, that is, by letting corporations pay less in taxes if they were patrons of the arts." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "Um, the Kennedy Centre in Washington D.C., you may uh…maybe you’ve been there, or Lincoln Centre in New York. Both of these were built with substantial financial support from corporations. And the Kennedy and Lincoln centers aren’t the only examples. Many of your cultural establishments in the United States will have a plaque somewhere acknowledging the support – the money they received from whatever corporation. Oh, yes, Janet?" },
        { "speaker": "Janet", "text": "But aren’t there a lot of people who don’t think it’s the government’s role to support the arts?" },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "Well, as a matter of fact, a lot of politicians who did not believe in government support for the arts, they wanted to do away with the agency entirely, for that very reason, to get rid of governmental support. But they only succeeded in taking away about half the annual budget. And as far as the public goes, well…there are about as many individuals who disagree with the government support as there are those who agree." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "In fact, with artists in particular, you have lots of artists who support and who have benefited from this agency, although it seems that just as many artists oppose the government agency being involved in the arts, for many different reasons, reasons like they don’t want the government to control what they create. In other words, the arguments both for and against government funding of the arts are as many and, and as varied as the individual styles of the artists who hold them." }

        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "Next, fecundity. Fecundity is the ability to reproduce in large numbers. For example, the common housefly reproduces by laying several thousand eggs, so each fly gene gets copied thousands of times. Memes, well, they can be reproduced in large numbers as well. How many times have you sung the ‘twinkle, twinkle song' to someone? Each time you replicated the song, and maybe passed it along to someone who did not know it yet, a small child maybe." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "And finally, fidelity. Fidelity means accuracy of the copying process. We know fidelity is an essential principle of genetic transmission. If a copy of a gene is a bit different from the original, that's called a genetic mutation. And mutations are usually bad news. An organism often cannot survive with a mutated gene. And so a gene usually cannot be passed on, unless it's an exact copy." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "For memes however, fidelity is not always so important. For example, if you tell someone the alligator story I told you today, it probably won't be word for word exactly as I said it. Still, it will be basically the same story, and the person who hears the story will be able to pass it along. Other memes are replicated with higher fidelity though, like the twinkle, twinkle song." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "It had the exact same words 20 years ago as it does now. Well, that's because we see songs as something that has to be performed accurately each time. If you change a word, the others will usually bring you in line. They'll say, ‘that's not how you sing it', right? So, you can see how looking at pieces of cultural information as replicators, as memes, and analyzing them in terms of longevity, fecundity and fidelity, we can gain some insight about how they spread, persist or change." }

        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "Last week, we covered some arguments against going back to the Moon. But there are compelling reasons in favor of another Moon landing too, um… not the least of which is trying to pinpoint the moon’s age. We could do this in theory by studying an enormous impact crater, known as the South Pole-Aitken Basin. Um…it’s located in the moon’s South Polar Region. But, since it’s on the far side of the moon, it can only be seen from space." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "Here is an image of…we’ll call it the SPA Basin. This color-coated image of the SPA Basin, those aren’t its actual colors obviously, this image is from the mid-90s, from the American spacecraft called Clementine. Um… unlike earlier lunar missions, Clementine didn’t orbit only around the moon’s equator." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "Its orbits enabled it to send back data to create this topographical map of … well, the grey and white area towards the bottom is the South Pole, the purples and blues in the middle correspond to low elevations - the SPA Basin itself, the oranges and reds around it are higher elevations." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "The basin measures an amazing 2,500 km in diameter, and its average depth is 12 km. That makes it the biggest known crater in our solar system and it may well be the oldest. You know planetary researchers love studying deep craters to learn about the impacts that created them, how they redistributed pieces of the planet’s crust." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "And in this case, we especially want to know if any of the mantle, the layer beneath the crust, was exposed by the impact. Not everyone agrees, but some experts are convinced that whatever created the SPA Basin did penetrate the Moon’s mantle. And we need to find out, because much more than the crust, the mantle contains information about a planet’s or Moon’s total composition. And that’s key to understanding planet formation." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "Um…Dian?" },
        { "speaker": "Dian", "text": "So, the only way to know the basin’s age is to study its rocks directly?" },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "Well, from radio survey data, we know that the basin contains lots of smaller craters. So it must be really old, about 4 billion years, give or take a few hundred million years. But that’s not very precise. If we had rock samples to study, we’d know whether these small craters were formed by impacts during the final stages of planetary formation, or if they resulted from later meteor showers." },
        { "speaker": "Dian", "text": "But if we know around how old the Basin is, I’m not sure that’s reason enough to go to the Moon again." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "No…, but such crude estimates…um…we can do better than that. Besides, there’s other things worth investigating, like is there water ice on the moon? Clementine’s data indicated that the wall of the south-polar crater was more reflective than expected. So some experts think there’s probably ice there. Also, data from a later mission indicates significant concentrations of hydrogen and by inference water, less than a meter underground at both poles." },
        { "speaker": "Student", "text": "Well, if there’s water, how did it get there? Underground rivers?" },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "We think meteors that crashed into the moon or tails of passing comets may have introduced water molecules. Any water molecules that found their way to the floors of craters near the moon’s poles, that water would be perpetually frozen, because the floors of those craters are always in shadow. Um…furthermore, if the water ice was mixed in with rock and dust, it would be protected from evaporation." },
        { "speaker": "Dian", "text": "So are you saying there might be primitive life on the moon?" },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "That’s not my point at all. Um… OK, say there is water ice on the moon. That would be of very practical value for a future moon base for astronauts. Water ice could be melted and purified for drinking. It could also be broken down into its component parts - oxygen and hydrogen. Oxygen could be used to breathe, and hydrogen could be turned into fuel, rocket fuel. So water ice could enable the creation of a self-sustaining moon base someday, a mining camp perhaps or a departure point for further space exploration." },
        { "speaker": "Student", "text": "But hauling tons of equipment to the moon to make fuel and build a life support system for a moon base, wouldn’t that be too expensive?" },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "Permanent base, maybe a ways off, but we shouldn’t have to wait for that. The dust at the bottom of the SPA Basin really does have a fascinating story to tell. I wouldn’t give for a few samples of it." }

You know, we have two introductory courses that are supposed to be taken before you get to my course, one in film art, techniques, technical stuff and another in film history. So students in the class you are in should be pretty far along in film studies.

        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "Okay. I know you all have a lot of questions about this lab assignment that's coming out so ... I'm gonna take a little time this morning to discuss it. So, you know the assignment has to do with Spectroscopy, right? And your reading should help you get a good idea of what that's all about. But, let's talk about Spectroscopy a little now just to cover the basics." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "What is Spectroscopy? Well, the simplest definition I can give you is that Spectroscopy is the study of the interaction between matter and light. Now, visible light consists of different colors or wavelengths, which together make up what's called spectrum, a band of colors, like you see in a rainbow." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "And all substances, all forms of matter, can be distinguished according to what wavelength of light they absorb and which ones they reflect. It's like, um, well, every element has, what we call, its own spectral signature. If we can read that signature, we can identify the element. And that's exactly what spectroscopy does." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "Now, Laser Spectroscopy, which is the focus of your assignment, works by measuring very precisely what parts of the spectrum are absorbed by different substances. And it has applications in a lot of different disciplines. And your assignment will be to choose a discipline that interests you, and devise an experiment." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "For example, I'm gonna talk about art. I'm interested in the art and to me it's interesting how spectroscopy is used to analyze art. Let's say a museum curator comes to you with a problem. She's come across this painting that appears to be an original - let's say, a Rembrandt. And she wants to acquire it for her museum. But she's got a problem: she's not absolutely certain it's an original. So, what do you do? How do you determine whether the painting's authentic?" },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "Okay. Think about the scientific process. You've got the question: Is the painting a Rembrandt? So first, you'll need to make a list of characteristics the painting would have to have to be a Rembrandt. Then you have to discover whether the painting in question has those characteristics." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "So first of all, you'll need to know the techniques Rembrandt used when he applied paint to canvas - his brushstrokes, how thickly he applied his paint. So you'd need to work with an art historian who has expert knowledge of Rembrandt's style. You'd have to know when he created his paintings, um... what pigments he used, in other words, what ingredients he used to make different colors of paint, ‘cause the ingredients used in paints and binding agents plus burnishes, finishes, what have you, have changed over time." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "Since you're trying to verify if it's a Rembrandt, the ingredients in the pigment would need to have been used during Rembrandt's lifetime - in the 17th century. And that's where chemistry comes in. You've got to find out what's in those pigments, learn their composition, and that requires lab work - detective work really - in a word, Spectroscopy." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "So, how do we use Spectroscopy? Well, we put an infrared microscope - a spectroscope - on tiny tiny bits of paint. And using ultraviolet light we can see the spectral signature of each component part of the pigment." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "Then we compare these signatures with those of particular elements like zinc or lead, to determine what the pigment was made of. So, you can see why this type of analysis requires a knowledge of the history of pigments, right? How and when they were made?" },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "Say we determined a pigment was made with zinc, for example. We know the spectral signature of zinc. And it matches that of the paint sample. We also know that zinc wasn't discovered until the 18th century. And since Rembrandt lived during the 17th century, we know he couldn't have painted it." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "Now, Spectroscopy has a very distinct advantage over previous methods of analyzing our works, because it's not invasive. You don't have to remove big chips of paint to do your analysis, which is what other methods require. All you do is to train the microscope on tiny flecks of paint and analyze them." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "Now a word or two about restoration. Sometimes original art works appear questionable or inauthentic because they've had so many restorers add touch-up layers to cover up damage, damage from the paint having deteriorated over time. Well, spectroscopy can reveal the composition of those touch-up layers too. So we can find out when they were applied. Then if we want to undo some bad restoration attempts, we can determine what kind of process we can use to remove them to dissolve the paint and uncover the original." }

        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "Now we can't really talk about fairy tales without first talking about folktales because there's a strong connection between these two genres, these two types of stories. In fact, many fairy tales started out as folktales. So, what's a folktale? How would you characterize them? Jeff?" },
        { "speaker": "Jeff", "text": "Well, they are old stories, traditional stories. They were passed down orally within cultures from generation to generation, so they changed a lot over time. I mean, every storyteller, or, maybe every town, might have had a slightly different version of the same folktale." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "That's right. There's local difference. And that's why we say folktales are communal. By communal, we mean they reflect the traits and the concerns of a particular community at a particular time. So essentially the same tale could be told in different communities, with certain aspects of the tale adapted to fit the specific community. Um, not the plot, the details of what happens in the story would remain constant. That was the thread that held the tale together. But all the other elements, like the location or characters, might be modified for each audience." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "Okay. So what about fairy tales? They also are found in most cultures, but how are they different from folktales? I guess the first question is: what is a fairy tale? And don't anyone say 'a story with a fairy in it' because we all know that very few fairy tales actually have those tiny magical creatures in them. But, what else can we say about them? Mary." },
        { "speaker": "Mary", "text": "Well, they seem to be less realistic than folktales... like they have something improbable happening - a frog turning into a prince, say. Oh, that's another common element, royalty - a prince or princess. And fairy tales all seem to take place in a location that's nowhere and everywhere at the same time." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "What's the line-up? How do all those stories start? Once upon a time, in a faraway land... oh, in the case of folktales, each storyteller would specify a particular location and time, though the time and location would differ for different storytellers. With fairy tales, however, the location is generally unspecified, no matter who the storyteller is. That land far away... We'll come back to this point in a few minutes." },
        { "speaker": "Student", "text": "Um... I, I thought that a fairy tale was just a written version of an oral folktale." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "Well, not exactly, though that is how many fairy tales developed. For example, in the late 18th century, the Grimm Brothers traveled throughout what's now Germany, recording local folktales. These were eventually published as fairy tales, but not before undergoing a process of evolution. Now, a number of things happen when an oral tale gets written down." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "First, the language changes. It becomes more formal, more standard - some might say, 'Less colorful'. It's like the difference in your language depending on whether you are talking to someone, or writing them a letter." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "Second, when an orally transmitted story is written down, an authoritative version with a recognized author is created. The communal aspect gets lost. The tale no longer belongs to the community. It belongs to the world, so to speak. Because of this, elements like place and time can no longer be tailored to suit a particular audience. So they become less identifiable, more generalizable to any audience." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "On the other hand, descriptions of characters and settings can be developed more completely. In folktales, characters might be identified by a name, but you wouldn't know anything more about them. But in fairy tales, people no longer have to remember plots. They're written down, right? So more energy can be put into other elements of the story like character and setting." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "So you get more details about the characters, about where the action takes place, what people's houses were like, ur, whether they're small cabins or grand palaces. And it's worth investing that energy because the story, now in book form, isn't in danger of being lost. Those details won't be forgotten. If a folktale isn't repeated by each generation, it may be lost for all time. But with a fairy tale, it's always there in a book, waiting to be discovered, again and again." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "Another interesting difference involves the change in audience. Who the stories are meant for? Contrary to what many people believe today, folktales were originally intended for adults, not for children. So, why is it that fairy tales seem targeted toward children nowadays?" }

And that was it for the year. Eventually, specially-bred multicolored tulips became so valuable. Well, according to records, one tulip bulb was worth 24 tons of wheat, or a thousand pounds of cheese. One particular tulip bulb was sold and exchanged for a small ship. In other words, tulips were literally worth their weight in gold." },

        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "OK, I have an interesting plant species to discuss with you today. Uh…it’s a species of a very rare tree that grows in Australia, Eidothea hardeniana, but it’s better known as the Nightcap Oak." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "Now, it was discovered only very recently, just a few years ago. Um… it remained hidden for so long because it’s so rare. There are only about 200 of them in existence. They grow in a rain forest, in a mountain range…range in the north part of New South Wales which is uh… a state in Australia. So just 200 individual trees in all." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "Now another interesting thing about the Nightcap Oak is that it is…it represents…uh…a very old type…uh…kind of tree that grew a hundred million years ago. Um, we found fossils that old that bear remarkable resemblance to the tree. So, it’s a primitive tree. A…a living fossil you might say. It’s relic from earlier times and it has survived all these years without much change. And it…it’s probably a kind of tree from which other trees that grow in Australia today evolved." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "Just to give you an idea of what we are talking about. Here’s a picture of the leaves of the tree and its flowers. I don’t know how well you can see the flowers. They’re those little clusters sitting at the base of the leaves." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "Okay, what have we tried to find out about the tree since we’ve discovered it? Hmm…or how…why is…is it so rare? It’s one of the first questions. Um… how is it…um…how does it reproduce? It’s another question. Um, maybe those two questions are actually related. Jim?" },
        { "speaker": "Student", "text": "Hmm …I don’t know. But I can imagine that…for instance, seed dispersal might be a factor. I mean if the…er…you know, if the seeds cannot really disperse in the wild area, then, you know, the tree may not colonize new areas. It can’t spread from the area where it’s growing." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "Right. That’s…that’s actually a very good answer. Uh, of course, you might think there might not be many areas where the tree could spread into, er…because…um…well, it’s very specialized in terms of the habitat. But, that’s not really the case here. Um…the suitable habitat, that is, the actual rainforest is much larger than the few hectares where the Nightcap Oak grows" },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "Now this tree is a flowering tree as I showed you. Um…um…it produces a fruit, much like a plum. On the inci…inside there’s a seed with a hard shell. It…it appears that the shell has to crack open or break down somewhat to allow the seed to soak up water. If the Nightcap Oak remains…if their seeds remain locked inside their shell, they will not germinate. Actually, the seeds…er…they don’t retain the power to germinate for very long, maybe two years." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "So there’s actually quite a short window of opportunity for the seed to germinate. So the shell somehow has to be broken down before this…um…germination ability expires. And…and then there’s a kind of rat that likes to feed on the seeds as well. So, given all these limitations, not many seeds that the tree produces will actually germinate. So this is a possible explanation for why the tree does not spread. It doesn’t necessarily explain how it became so rare, but it explains why it doesn’t increase." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "OK, so it seems to be the case that the species, this Nightcap Oak is not very good at spreading. However, it seems, though we can’t be sure, that it’s very good at persisting as a population. Um…we…there’s some indications to suggest that the population of the Nightcap Oak has not declined over the last. er…you know, many hundreds of years." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "So it’s stayed quite stable. It’s not a remnant of some huge population that is dwindled in the last few hundred years for some reason. It’s not necessarily a species in retreat. Ok, so it cannot spread very well, but it’s good at maintaining itself. It’s rare, but it’s not disappearing." },

See, I’ve never had a linguistics class before, so I was sort of, I mean, I was looking over the course description and a lot of the stuff you described there. I just don’t know what it is talking about, you know, or what it means. But there was one thing that really did jump out at me." },

        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "So, you want some pointers where to go for information on the subject? Well, you could always start by reading the chapter in the book on sociolinguistics. That will give you a basic understanding of the key issues involved here." },
        { "speaker": "Student", "text": "Yeah, that’s what I thought. So I started reading the chapter, you know, about how everyone speaks some dialect of the language. And I’m wondering like, well, how do we even manage to understand each other at all?" },

        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "OK, all right. Dialect accommodation is a more manageable sort of topic." },
        { "speaker": "Student", "text": "So I was thinking like, I wonder just how much other people do the same thing. I mean, there are students here from all over the place. Does everyone change the way they talk to some degree depending on whom they are talking to?" },

        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "Alright everybody, the topic for today is, well, we’re gonna take a look at how to start creating the characters for the stories you’re writing. One way of doing that is to come up with what’s called 'a character sketch', I don’t mean a sketch like a drawing, I guess that’s obvious. It’s um…it’s a…a sketch is a way of getting started on defining your characters’ personalities." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "To begin, how do we create fictional characters? We don’t just pull them from thin air, do we? I mean we don’t create them out of nothing. We base them, consciously or unconsciously, we base them on real people, or we blend several people’s traits, their attributes into one character. But when people think fiction, they may assume the characters come from the author’s imagination." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "But the writer’s imagination is influenced by… by real people, could be anyone. So, pay attention to the people you meet: someone in class, at the gym, that guy who is always sitting in the corner at the coffee house, um… your cousin, who’s always getting into dangerous situations. We’re pulling from reality, gathering bits and pieces of real people. You use these people, and the bits of behavior or characteristics as a starting point as you begin to sketch out your characters." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "Here is what you should think about doing first. When you begin to formulate a story, make a list of interesting people you know or have observed. Consider why they’re unique or annoying. Then make notes about their unusual or dominant attributes." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "As you create fictional characters, you’ll almost always combine characteristics from several different people on your list to form the identity and personality of just one character. Keeping this kind of character sketch can help you solidify your character’s personality, so that it remains consistent throughout your story." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "You need to define your characters, know their personalities so that you can have them acting in ways that are predictable, consistent with their personalities. Get to know them like a friend. You know your friends well enough to know how they’ll act in certain situations, right?" },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "Say you have three friends, their car runs out of gas on the highway. John gets upset. Mary remains calm. Teresa takes charge of handling the situation. And let’s say, both John and Mary defer to her leadership. They call you to explain what happen. And when John tells you he got mad, you’re not surprised, because he always gets frustrated when things go wrong. Then he tells you how Teresa took charge, calmed him down, assigned tasks for each person and got them on their way." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "Again, you’re not surprised. It’s exactly what you’d expect. Well, you need to know your characters, like you know your friends. If you know a lot about a person’s character, it’s easy to predict how they’ll behave. So if your characters’ personalities are well defined, it will be easy for you as the writer to portray them realistically…er…believably, in any given situation." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "While writing character sketches, do think about details. Ask yourself questions, even if you don’t use the details in your story. Um…what does each character like to eat, what setting does each prefer, the mountains, the city, what about educational background, their reactions to success or defeat. Write it all down." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "But, here I need to warn you about a possible pitfall. Don’t make your character into a stereotype. Remember the reader needs to know how your character is different from other people who might fall in the same category. Maybe your character loves the mountains and has lived in a remote area for years." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "To make sure he is not a stereotype, ask yourself how he sees life differently from other people who live in that kind of setting. Be careful not to make him into the cliché of the 'ragged mountain dweller'." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "Okay, now, I’ll throw out a little terminology. It’s easy stuff. Major characters are sometimes called 'round characters'. Minor characters are sometimes called, well, just the opposite, 'flat'. A round character is fully developed; a flat character isn’t. Character development is fairly limited. The flat character tends to serve mainly as a motivating factor." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "For instance, you introduce a flat character who has experienced some sort of defeat. And then your round, your main character who loves success and loves to show off, comes and boasts about succeeding and jokes about the flat character’s defeat in front of others, humiliates the other guy. The flat character is introduced solely for the purpose of allowing the round character to show off." }

I mean, you wouldn't call it a tropical paradise or anything, uh...or maybe you would if you think about how today in some parts of the Sahara it...it only rains about once a century. Um... but basically, you had greenery and you had water." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "And what I find particularly interesting... amazing really, what really indicates how undesert-like the Sahara was thousands of years ago, was something painted on the rock, prehistoric art – hippopotamuses. As you know hippos need a lot of water and hence? Hence what?" },
        { "speaker": "Student", "text": "They need to live near a large source of water year around." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "That's right." },

        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "Okay, in principle they could, Karl. But the rock paintings aren't the only evidence. Beneath the Sahara are huge aquifers, basically a sea of fresh water, that's perhaps a million years old filtered through rock layers. And...er...and then there is fossilized pollen, from low shrubs and grasses that once grew in the Sahara." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "In fact these plants still grow, er...but hundreds of miles away, in more vegetated areas. Anyway, it's this fossilized pollen along with the aquifers and the rock paintings, these three things are all evidence that the Sahara was once much greener than it is today, that there were hippos and probably elephants and giraffes and so on." },
        { "speaker": "Student", "text": "So what happened?" },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "How did it happen? Well, Now, we're so used to hearing about how human activities are affecting the climate, right? But that takes the focus away from the natural variations in the earth climate, like the Ice Age, right? The planet was practically covered in ice just a few thousand years ago. Now as far as the Sahara goes, there is some recent literature that points to the migration of the monsoon in that area." },
        { "speaker": "Students", "text": "Huh?????" },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "What do I mean? Okay, a monsoon is a seasonal wind that can bring in a large amount of rainfall. Now if the monsoon migrates, well, that means that the rains move to another area, right?" },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "So what caused the monsoon to migrate? Well, the answer is: the dynamics of earth's motions, the same thing that caused the Ice Age by the way. The earth's not always the same distance from the sun, and it's not always tilting toward the sun at the same angle. There are slight variations in these two parameters. They're gradual variations but their effects can be pretty abrupt. And can cause the climate to change in just a few hundred years." },
        { "speaker": "Student", "text": "That's abrupt?" },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "Well, yeah, considering that other climate shifts take thousands of years, this one is pretty abrupt. So these changes in the planet's motions, they caused the climate to change." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "But it was also compounded. What the Sahara experienced was uh...a sort of 'runaway drying effect'. As I said the monsoon migrated itself, so there was less rain in the Sahara. the land started to get drier, which in turn caused a huge decrease in the amount of vegetation, because vegetation doesn't grow as well in dry soil, right?" },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "And then, less vegetation means the soil can't hold water as well, the soil loses its ability to retain water when it does rain. So then you have less moisture to help clouds form, nothing to evaporate for cloud formation. And then the cycle continues, less rain, drier soil, less vegetation, fewer clouds, less rain etc. etc." },
        { "speaker": "Student", "text": "But, what about the people who made the rock paintings?" },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "Good question. No one really knows. But there might be some connections to ancient Egypt." },
        { "speaker": "Student", "text": "Oh..." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "At about the same time that the Sahara was becoming a desert...hmm ...5,000 years ago, Egypt really began to flourish out in the Nile River valley. And that's not that far away. So it's only logical to hypothesize that a lot of these people migrated to the Nile valley when they realized that this was more than a temporary drought." },
        { "speaker": "Professor", "text": "And some people take this a step further. And that's okay, that's science and they hypothesize that this migration actually provided an important impetus in the development of ancient Egypt. Well, we'll stay tuned on that." }
